The game was largely a tale of two halves , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] dominating the first two quarters despite missing two starters on offense , and jumping out to a 46 - 35 lead by intermission .

However , only var_player[1][5][DREB] other var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] player managed to get into double digits in the scoring column , and that effort came from the bench in the person of var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][5][PTS] points ) . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][PTS] points ) , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][PTS] points ) and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][PF] points ) considerably underwhelmed , while var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] particularly struggled from long range , shooting just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 10 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] Wednesday at the FedExForum in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

Not far behind was var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who had var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG ) , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , an assist , and a block . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also passed the double - digit benchmark and finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points to go along with var_player[0][4][FG3M] rebound , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , and a steal . The other starting guard , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , shot var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][PF] - for - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from behind the arc to score var_player[0][3][PTS] points in 35 minutes of action . Despite the win , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got little output from their bench unit , who only scored 10 of their var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] total points . With a ton of fresh faces , this was finally a shot for var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' fans to see their new young lineup . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was very efficient in his debut , scoring var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][OREB] - var_player[1][1][FG3A] 3PT , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][REB] FT ) and grabbing var_player[1][1][FTM] rebounds , var_player[1][1][REB] assists , and var_player[1][1][PF] steals . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's efficiency and added var_player[1][1][FGA] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][PF] - var_player[1][6][PF] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][REB] - var_player[1][1][FTM] FT ) of his own . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] also contributed var_player[1][6][FTM] assists and a steal . No . var_player[1][0][FG3M] overall pick var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] made his regular season debut but only had var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , an assist , and var_player[1][0][FGM] steals , playing just 18 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game is on the road Friday against the Indiana Pacers , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Detroit Pistons on Thursday in Detroit .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] seized control of this game from the very start , opening up a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 14 lead after the first quarter . They also ended the contest on a very strong note , winning the fourth quarter 42 - 18 . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] once again led the way for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as he continues to play his best basketball of the season . He had 26 points ( 12 - 22 FG ) and nine rebounds , and in his last five games is averaging 25 points and 10 rebounds in his last five games . var_player[0][5][FIRST_NAME] Bogdonavic was not far behind , scoring var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FG3A] - var_player[0][5][FG3M] 3Pt ) in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][6][PTS] ) and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][PTS] ) were the only other var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] players to score in double figures , and while he did not reach double figure scoring , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] still put together a solid stat line of var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][TO] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][FTM] - var_player[0][1][REB] 3Pt ) , var_player[0][4][PTS] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . The win , along with a Celtics win , leaves the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in a tie for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference , but they are losing the tiebreaker to Boston . They currently hold a 2 - game lead over the Pacers for that position with just three games left to play in the regular season . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] rested John_Wall for the second night in a row , as they do not have much to play for as the season winds down . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] played well in the losing effort , scoring a team - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTA] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a monster double - double of var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] filled in for Wall once again , but struggled shooting the ball , going var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_player[1][4][REB] from the field for var_player[1][4][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . Even with the loss , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is sitting comfortably in fifth place in the East , and since they are unable to move up or down in the standings regardless of the outcomes for these final three games in the regular season . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will head to Milwaukee Sunday to take on the Bucks , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head home Sunday and play the East-leading Hawks .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] at Staples Center on Sunday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ended a short , but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road , and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played at a high speed pace , led by var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who diced through the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defense and took advantage of his matchup with var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds overshadowed his var_player[1][4][TO] turnovers , which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game . The former No . var_player[1][2][STL] overall pick ran impressive sets with var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes , and turned in var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] team fouls , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot a poor 16 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] from the free throw line . Given the amount of times that var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] put var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] on the line , the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout . var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was no match defending var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] from getting to the rim , but he did equal his opponents scoring with var_player[1][4][PTS] points of his own . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] has a handful of games left in his career , and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it 's head a few times during the game . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebound and var_player[0][0][AST] assists on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting , but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times , which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will visit the Utah Jazz ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Monday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head north to take on the Golden_State Warriors ( 66 - 7 ) .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . With var_player[0][10][FG_PCT] seconds left in the game , var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] was able to hit a jumper and put the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] up var_player[0][10][FTA] . It was Dejuan var_player[1][8][SECOND_NAME] who came up big for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] though , banking in a shot to tie the game with just over var_player[1][8][REB] seconds left in the game . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation , but he missed and it went to overtime . In overtime , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs . Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game , but we now know for sure who each will play . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will play the Boston Celtics . With LeBron_James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes , it was the bench that took over this game for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] had the biggest games off the bench . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][6][FGM] - for - var_player[0][6][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][6][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][6][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][6][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][AST] steals . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , went var_player[0][7][FGM] - for - var_player[0][7][FGA] from the floor and var_player[0][7][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][7][FG3A] from deep to score var_player[0][7][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[0][7][AST] assists and var_player[0][7][FTM] steals . The double - double was the first for var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] on the year , while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] was the other bench player to reach double figures . In 21 minutes , he finished with 12 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and eight rebounds , boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes . Playing just var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes with the starters , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FG3A] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][1][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][1][DREB] rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest . Like the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] rested the majority of their players , as var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] were all held out of this matchup . It was var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] who had the biggest outing , as he came off the bench for var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FG3A] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FG3M] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FTM] - var_player[1][6][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][6][FG3M] rebounds over var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward , as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was another reason the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to keep this game close . He finished with 17 points ( 7 - 19 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and two steals , while playing 45 minutes . It was a nice end to the season for var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] , who finishes the year with averages of var_player[1][0][FG3A] points and var_player[1][0][FG3M] rebounds over 74 games . Both var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures in points as well . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][5][REB] points ( var_player[1][4][AST] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FT_PCT] - var_player[1][4][TO] FT ) , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][BLK] blocked shots , while var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][AST] - var_player[1][4][REB] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][AST] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . This marks the final regular season game for both teams , but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday night . The game was a tale of two halves , as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead , but blew it in the second half with some bad defense . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] outscored var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_player[1][0][MIN] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] in the third quarter and went to var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] to close things out at the end . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won . It was a vintage var_player[1][0][FIRST_NAME] performance , as he carried the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to a much needed win . He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] both played good as well , as they scored 36 points combined . The offense has been terrible all season , for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , but this var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - spot will hopefully get them going . Their next game will be on Christmas , when they take on the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] Clippers . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter , but managed to choke that away . They let the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] go on a var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] scored 18 points in the first quarter , but really struggled after that , finishing with var_player[0][5][PTS] in the game .

The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points , 15 rebounds , seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] was var_player[0][1][OREB] of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort , managing a var_player[0][1][FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field , including draining var_player[0][1][BLK] of his var_player[0][1][FG3A] attempts from three - point range . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FTA] of var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting . However , the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds , seven assists and a pair of steals . The perpetually dependable var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role , pitching in with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , an assist and a block . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] was highly productive off the bench with a season - high var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points , leading the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' reserves . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division , Western Conference and the entire NBA .

Coming only var_player[1][3][STL] rebound shy of a triple - double , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] also went off and scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had to sit out the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' last var_player[1][4][FTA] games with a hamstring injury but was able to return in this var_player[1][4][FTM] and scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points , going var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][4][PF] - for - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from the three - point line . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the fourth Rocket starter in double - digits , as he added var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][TO] - var_player[1][0][TO] FT ) and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][2][PTS] and var_player[0][3][PTS] points a piece to lead the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in scoring . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] also had var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and is now averaging 25 points and 11 rebounds on the season . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench again but played var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes compared to starter var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who only notched var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes and went scoreless . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][6][PTS] points , shooting var_player[0][6][FGM] - for - var_player[0][6][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][6][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][6][REB] from beyond the three - point line . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued to start for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , and he finished the game with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FTA] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTA] 3Pt , var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[0][1][PF] rebounds .

The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Wednesday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . All-Star center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] paved the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_player[0][2][FTA] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to earn the easy win , scoring var_player[0][2][PTS] points and pulling down var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] ' rebounding effort helped the team establish a 46 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] rebounding advantage against the normally tough var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] points , but turned the ball over var_player[0][4][FTM] times while dishing var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] assists . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , and forward var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] each added var_player[0][4][FG3M] three - pointers , contributing to the var_player[0][4][FGA] made by the team on the night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] reached a .500 record at home with the win . For the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) , things are continuing to get worse after the team started a surprising 5 - 1 to open the season . Point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , however , has not seemed to slow down . The NBA 's leading scorer scored another 31 points on Wednesday , to go along with 11 rebounds and nine assists . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's numbers thus far have indicated that he may have a chance at being the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double in a season . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continued to struggle from deep in Tuesday 's contest , shooting just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . The team hit just seven triples in the contest . The thunder will travel to Denver on Friday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Houston Rockets .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got out to a quick start in this one , grabbing a var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - 18 lead right away after the first quarter . It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to pull off a huge win , as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and a disgraceful var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with a team - high of var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][1][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTA] - var_player[0][1][FTM] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][PF] assists in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward , as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday 's game against the Warriors . He 's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year . Also getting a piece of the action was var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][DREB] - var_player[0][4][TO] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FG3M] FT ) and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . It was his second strong showing in a row , as he 's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win , as they were extremely productive . Rookie T.J. var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] had a breakout performance and scored var_player[0][8][PTS] points ( var_player[0][8][FGM] - var_player[0][8][FGA] FG , var_player[0][8][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][8][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][8][FTM] - var_player[0][8][PF] FT ) in just var_player[0][8][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate , so it 's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he 's got . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] also reached double figures off the bench , with var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][OREB] - var_player[0][5][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][FG3M] - var_player[0][5][OREB] FT ) and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] did his best to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in this game . He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points . After shooting just 25 percent ( 2 - 8 FG ) from the field in Monday 's game against the Clippers , it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday . In a solid performance off the bench , var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[1][9][FGM] - for - var_player[1][9][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][9][PF] - for - var_player[1][9][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a season - high of var_player[1][9][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][9][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][9][DREB] blocked shots . It was a nice surprise for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season . With var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] sitting out on a night of rest , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season . In 29 minutes , he finished with 10 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] did n't have much of an impact either , as he also had just var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][PF] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Oklahoma_City to play the Thunder on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were blown out of the building in their home opener Friday against the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) , losing var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] jumped out to a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] advantage after the first quarter and kept pouring it on throughout the contest , leading 50 - 33 at the break and outscoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in the final var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] quarters as well . Though var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , they ran away with the game by winning the turnover battle by a huge margin , surrendering the ball just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] times to the Sixers ' 18 giveaways . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the backcourt with var_player[1][1][FGA] and var_player[1][6][PTS] points , respectively , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] secured a double - double with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] boards to accompany var_player[1][6][TO] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] compounded their turnover problems by shooting even worse than var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] from the field , submitting a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent mark as a team . The chief offender was star center var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who accrued just var_player[0][1][PTS] points while going var_player[0][1][BLK] - for - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the field . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game , a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago . Up next for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is a date with the Indiana Pacers in the second game of a road back - to - back set . The Sixers will attempt to pick up their first win of the season Monday against the Cleveland Cavaliers .
var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a massive line as he notched his 25th triple - double of the season , with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] scored 15 unanswered points , as a part of his 19 - point fourth quarter that propelled the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to the win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] followed up with a double - double consisting of var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting , and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] came up big with var_player[0][6][PTS] points on var_player[0][6][FGM] - of - var_player[0][6][DREB] shooting , including var_player[0][6][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][5][FG3A] from deep , in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][5][PTS] points in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . Meanwhile , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the Grizz , with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , along with var_player[1][2][AST] assists , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][STL] steals and var_player[1][2][TO] block , var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed up with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][STL] steals , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] rebound .
Despite the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] losing var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] straight games coming into Sunday and the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] winning var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] of var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to pull out a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] road win . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] once again carried the load for the visitors , as they have been the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' top var_player[1][0][FG3M] scorers in every game they 've both played this season . This was actually the first game that at least two other starters scored in double figures for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] for the entirety of the season . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] stars really struggled shooting , as var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined to go 12 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] in the loss . The var_player[0][3][PTS] - point outing from var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was his lowest of the season , as he had n't scored below 32 points all year . With var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] out of the lineup with a knee contusion , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] really struggled down low . In fact , they had no big man reach double figures in scoring or rebounding , while being outscored in the paint 52 - 30 .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Barclays Center on Thursday evening . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came into Thursday on what could , by their standards , be considered a hot streak . They 'd tallied five victories in 12 games in March but they were chasing a particularly significant win against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year , improbable as that sounds . Early on , it appeared the dubious streak would endure , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell by a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] margin after one quarter . However , they roared back in the second by outscoring var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] by a 30 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] outscored their visitors , 74 - 48 , over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season . A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column , and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] played a stellar defensive game overall , limiting the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who managed var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FG3M] steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued his recent stretch of excellent play with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][STL] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] block . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] followed with an var_player[1][2][REB] - point , var_player[1][2][PTS] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][2][FG3M] assist , var_player[1][2][TO] steals and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with a var_player[1][4][PTS] - point , var_player[1][4][AST] - assist double - double that also featured a pair of steals . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] boards , var_player[1][5][STL] assist and var_player[1][5][AST] steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][FG3M] block . K.J . var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] followed with a bench - leading var_player[0][8][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[0][8][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][8][AST] assist , var_player[0][8][OREB] steals and var_player[0][8][AST] block . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][REB] boards and var_player[0][9][PF] assist . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][FG3A] rebounds . var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] contributed matching var_player[0][5][PTS] - point efforts as reserves . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] compiled var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][PF] rebounds , var_player[0][6][FGM] assists , var_player[0][6][FG3A] steals and var_player[0][6][BLK] block over var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][10][PTS] points and var_player[0][10][FG3A] rebound . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] mustered a modest var_player[0][1][PTS] points but hauled in var_player[0][1][REB] boards , dished out var_player[0][1][FTA] assists , recorded var_player[0][1][FGM] steals and posted var_player[0][1][BLK] block . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] next head to Boston to take on the Celtics on Friday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head to Washington to take on the Wizards on Friday evening as well .
University of Kentucky alumni filled the stat sheet in Friday 's Suns-Kings game , as var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] all made significant impacts for their respective teams . For var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][3][PTS] points and shot var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , meanwhile , had var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , and var_player[1][4][DREB] assists . As a team , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot only var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent , but made 12 three - pointers and was a solid 29 - of - 35 from the free - throw line . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , saw a triple - double from var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][AST] rebounds , and var_player[0][1][AST] assists .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot a stellar 44 percent from the field , but held a significant disadvantage at the free - throw line .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at the Staples Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . With their victory over var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] moves within a half game of the Eastern Conference leading Toronto Raptors . Meanwhile , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is now tied with New_Orleans for the eigth seed in the Western Conference . Despite the double - digit victory , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] trailed var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 50 - 48 going into halftime . As the game transitioned to the second half , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's offense heated up as they shot an outstanding 59 percent until the end of the game , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] only shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had all five starters score in double - digits , with var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] leading the way scoring var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) , while also contributing var_player[1][3][FGM] rebounds and a game - high var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] assists . While he only had var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG ) , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was able to make a tremendous impact as he had a season - high var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists . Coming off the bench , rookie forward var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] had an extremely solid performance , as he had 11 points ( var_player[1][5][PF] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FG3M] - var_player[1][5][FG3A] 3Pt ) , while also grabbing var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came in to Monday 's contest a bit short - handed , as var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] was given the night off to rest his 35 - year - old body . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] took advantage of their matchup against the worst team in the league to rest their defensive stalwart , but lately , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] ) have played hard regardless of the circumstances .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had finally cooled off just slightly after a torrid 13 - game winning streak with two consecutive losses coming in to Wednesday , and the probability of a third straight defeat loomed large considering the quality of their opponent and the hostile venue . However , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] assured themselves of heading into the All-Star break on a positive note with a spectacular shooting night and consistent effort across all four quarters . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] posted a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field , with four members of the first unit managing double digits in the scoring column . Meanwhile , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] did generate var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][REB] - rebound , var_player[0][4][REB] - assist triple - double that also included a block , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) saw the other var_player[0][4][FG3M] members of their starting var_player[0][4][PF] combine for just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] points , and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-REB] percent from the field overall . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with matching var_player[1][2][PTS] - point efforts . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] also hauled in var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , dished out var_player[1][3][OREB] assist , and recorded var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks , while var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was right behind his teammates with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][4][TO] rebound . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][PF] assists , var_player[1][0][OREB] rebound and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] boards and var_player[1][5][AST] assists . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a distant second behind var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][BLK] assist . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other member of the starting var_player[0][2][FGM] to hit double digits , posting var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][FTM] rebounds . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's point total and added var_player[0][6][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][2][REB] assists and var_player[0][6][FTM] steal in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] notably combined for just 12 points , with the former exiting after just 12 minutes with a strained left groin muscle .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot much better than the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in this game , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and an impressive var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] out - rebounded the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] , but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance , as they dropped a tough loss at home . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] got hot from the floor for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , going var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][3][FGM] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[1][3][PTS] points . It was his second solid game in a row , combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] came just shy of a double - double , finishing with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][REB] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds and var_player[1][2][FTA] blocked shots . He has n't been doing much scoring for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] so far this season , as he 's averaging only 7 points per game on the year , so the 15 points were a nice surprise . In var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures as well , scoring var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][OREB] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , while also adding var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FTM] steals and a blocked shot .

Both var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures in points as well . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][TO] - var_player[0][3][REB] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][OREB] - var_player[0][3][TO] FT ) , var_player[0][3][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists , while var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FG3A] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][5][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][FTM] - var_player[0][3][DREB] FT ) and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds .

While the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have seen some cold shooting nights so far this season , Friday 's matchup saw the worst splits for the team in recent memory . Reigning MVP Steph var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][4][OREB] - for - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from beyond the arc , failing to hit a var_player[1][4][FTM] - pointer for the first time in 157 games . As the NBA record fell , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's backcourt partner var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] saw struggles of his own , going just var_player[1][4][STL] - of - var_player[1][3][PTS] from downtown . On the whole , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went just 5 - of - 32 from beyond the arc , their lowest three - point output of the season . Rebounding proved to be another major factor in the game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] pulled down a season - high var_player[0][1][REB] boards , helping to give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 40 rebounding advantage .

Both of those patterns held true Saturday , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] compiled a whopping 77 points in the first half on their way to a blowout home win . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[0][4][FG3M] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds . With Eric_Bledsoe sitting out for rest , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] could n't come close to keeping pace , and shot just var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] percent overall , which largely negated the var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers they elicited from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the visitors with var_player[1][3][FGA] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][3][FG3M] rebound and var_player[1][3][FG3M] steal .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the New_Orleans Pelicans on Monday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] welcome the Miami Heat on Wednesday night .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hung around all game , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] led for nearly var_team[1][TEAM-REB] minutes in an impressive performance . The second half is when var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] really turned it on , as they scored 61 points and committed just one turnover . The assist - to - turnover margin was a huge factor , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] committed var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers with var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] committed just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers to their 31 assists . The var_player[1][1][PTS] points from var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] marks a season - high and this is the first time all season that all var_player[1][1][FTA] starters scored in double figures . The var_player[1][4][AST] assists from var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] more than doubles his previous season - high of five . The var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][FG3M] three - pointers are a season - high for var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] as well , as those var_player[0][3][FG3M] threes nearly matches his season total from last season . The var_player[0][3][FT_PCT] combined points from var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] were the only reason var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] hung around , as the other nine players combined for just 29 points .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dominated the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] en route to a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] win in Wednesday night 's season opener in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . All eyes were on fourth overall pick var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] Porzingus , who did not disappoint in his NBA regular season debut for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , scoring var_player[1][1][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . But the most surprising performance for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came from var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] . A lottery pick back in 2011 , var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] exploded for var_player[1][5][PTS] points on var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][5][FGA] shooting and ripped down var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds in just var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . The performances of Porzingus and var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] overshadowed the return of var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] . After undergoing knee surgery in February , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] missed much of the 2014 - 15 season . He had plenty of time to rehab this offseason , but came out flat in the opener with a minuscule 11 points ( 4 - 16 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , six rebounds and five assists in 29 minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench ended up outscoring the starters 73 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was missing three key players Wednesday ; Jabari_Parker ( knee ) , var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( suspension ) , and O.J . var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] ( hamstring ) . With much of the core sidelined , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received big games from both their stars ; var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . Unfortunately they did n't get much help from anyone else . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] tallied a double - double in his regular - season debut for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , scoring var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) while pulling down var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and adding var_player[0][2][AST] assists . MCW tacked on 20 points despite struggling from the field , shooting 6 - for - 17 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to improve to 20 Thursday night at Madison Square Garden against the Hawks . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will hope to bounce back Friday against the Wizards at home .

Meanwhile , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] duo of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a var_player[0][4][PTS] - foot three - point jumper with var_player[0][4][FTM] seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's fate . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did manage to lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][4][PTS] points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain var_player[1][4][FTM] of var_player[1][4][FTA] attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] contributed a modest var_player[1][3][PTS] points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds for his first double - double of the season . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's scoring total and added var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][3][PF] assists , a steal and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks , var_player[0][2][OREB] of which were key stuffs of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] put together a solid contribution of var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][BLK] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FG3M] steals , while var_player[1][1][FG3M] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] reserves were highly efficient . Corey var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] led the way with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][DREB] assists , var_player[1][5][PF] rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with a pair of var_player[1][5][FGA] - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] for the team lead in that category on the afternoon . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][4][PTS] points were supplemented by var_player[0][4][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][4][REB] assists and a pair of steals . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] was right on his heels with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][AST] rebounds and a steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double , which he complemented with var_player[0][2][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board , tallying var_player[0][0][PTS] on the scoreboard and hauling in var_player[0][0][REB] off the glass . He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] was outstanding off the bench in the first half for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][9][PTS] points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period . He did add five rebounds , four assists and a block . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench had a very poor showing , contributing only15 points . They just did n't have the scoring balance to keep it close .

A var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] blowout appeared to be the likely result with the recent form of these teams and that was just the case in this easy 12 - point win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to grab two early leads , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held a double - digit lead for the final var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] minutes to keep things at ease .

Defense was key for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] as well , as they held var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting , while forcing them to commit var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , on the other hand , committed just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers and recorded var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's var_team[1][TEAM-AST] .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have now won var_player[0][4][FTM] - straight games , as the return of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ca n't be understated . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was the player of the game in this win , collecting var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , and var_player[0][4][AST] assists on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] only scored var_player[0][2][PTS] points , but snatched down var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) easily defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at the Verizon Center on Friday . With the game comfortably in hand , the second seed in the East was able to limit their players ' court time , with var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] leading the team with only var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes played . The var_player[0][4][AST] assists var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] distributed made it var_player[0][4][FG3A] consecutive games with double - digit helpers . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] returned to action , after sitting out the previous var_player[0][6][DREB] games with plantar fasciitis , but was n't immediately inserted into the starting lineup . He scored eight points with eight rebounds in 18 minutes off the bench . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who started in place of var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , which came on the back of his var_player[0][1][PTS] - rebound performance Wednesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was scorching from the field , hitting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their field goal attempts , compared with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who could manage just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent conversion . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] travel to Boston to take on the struggling Celtics on Sunday . While var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] is beginning a nice little streak of double - digit assist games , he 's got a while to go before he catches var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who extended his run to var_player[0][4][FGA] games with double - digit assists . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][FGM] steals to his var_player[1][4][FGA] assists . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other member of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to score in double - digits , dropping var_player[1][0][PTS] points in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . Coach Brian Shaw limited var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's minutes yet again , keeping the Team USA member to just var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][1][PTS] points with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in his limited action . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to reverse their slide Sunday against the Hawks , having lost their last two games .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Sleep Train Arena on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took care of business on their home court en route to their 30th win of the season , which marked the first time since 2007 - 2008 , but the a bizarre final var_player[0][2][REB] seconds of play resulted in a double technical at the expense of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] . Following a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bucket , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] appeared to mock the refs , walking towards their bench both clapping simultaneously . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was then ejected for arguing with the ref , and var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] earned his 16th technical foul of the season . If all holds up , both players will likely be suspended for their next game . Despite the strange ending , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had little trouble handling their opponent on the second game of a back - to - back for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . The first quarter went in favor of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] got them off to a hot start after scoring var_player[1][4][DREB] points and adding var_player[1][4][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FGM] assists in that first period . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] is accustomed to dealing dimes against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , his season high 19 assists came against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] late in December . From there on out var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] went on to score at will and abuse his matchup with var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] got some life back in them when Otto_Porter_Jr . went on a scoring run in the third quarter , but poor shot selection in the final period sank their chances of overcoming the deficit . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] completed his 36th double - double of the season with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] elite duo looked fresh after sitting out against the Trail_Blazers on Monday . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] either knocked down his midrange jumpers , but failed to convert a var_player[0][0][FTM] - pointer , as he finished var_player[0][0][BLK] - of - var_player[0][0][FTM] from behind the arc . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] boards . The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] bench saw var_player[0][6][FG3A] standout double figure performances from var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , with the latter of the trio impressively completing a double - double alongside var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] Jr. aided the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the scoring department , as var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's jump shot failed him for a second consecutive game . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][REB] assists , while also providing a highlight of his handles after taking advantage of the flat footed var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] for a pretty crossover . Most of var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] Jr 's var_player[1][0][PTS] points came in the third quarter , but his shooting was efficient after going var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] out - rebounded and out - assisted the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , but even after shooting var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , it was not enough to match the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lights out var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting as a unit . Both teams will suit up on Friday , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the MIami Heat ( 43 - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] visit the Phoenix Suns ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - 55 ) .
var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] has put together an unbelievable month of January , and his performance in Tuesday 's win over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was the perfect finish . After scoring a game - high var_player[0][0][MIN] points in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes against var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] officially scored in double figures in all var_player[0][0][FGM] games in January , scored at least var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points var_player[0][0][FTA] times , 30 points six times and even had his career - high 41 points in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's overtime victory over the Cavaliers . With January officially over , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished the month averaging 29 points per game and shooting 52 percent from the field and 43 percent from behind the arc - - both of which would be his best of the season by month . With that , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] enters February in the top 10 in points per game and top 15 in var_player[0][0][TO] - point shooting percentage .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] narrowly escaped var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] victory against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Saturday night at BMO Harris Bradley Center . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] jumped out of the gate with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] first quarter , perhaps catching the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] lagging on the second night of a back - to - back . However , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] answered right back with a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - 29 second quarter to take a 69 - 66 lead into halftime . After trailing by 14 with 6:56 left in the fourth , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] battled back to make it a two - point game with two minutes to go but could not capitalize on multiple opportunities to tie or take the lead . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had a great night offensively , shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and 10 - of - 20 from long range , while also filling it up with var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] points in the paint . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] tallied var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists , led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[0][0][AST] assists , along with a team - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][STL] steals and var_player[0][0][BLK] block , in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the second half of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_player[0][1][PF] - var_player[0][1][DREB] punch , as he finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , along with var_player[0][1][REB] assists , var_player[0][1][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][1][FG3A] steals , in var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes . This was the third loss in a row for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , who go on to host the Orlando Magic on Monday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) notched their second win in as many nights and seventh straight as they scored their way to victory in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have found their groove and are scoring like many expected they would , averaging 123 points per game in their last five contests . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way in this var_player[1][0][BLK] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting , along with var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steals in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was efficient as well with var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FG3_PCT] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dished var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists or more for the seventh time in a row , which is a testament to how dangerous they can be offensively , sharing the ball between multiple scorers . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] look to extend their streak as they visit Indiana for a contest against the Pacers on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Staples Center on Monday . Both the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] control the 4 - seed in their respective conferences , but var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] proved once again that the elite teams in the Western Conference are more overpowering than the elite teams in the Eastern Conference . Isiah var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and company physically battled their way through the first quarter , but still came out six points down , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] simply built on their lead during the rest of the game . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] chased down var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] in transition for a highlight block , but it did not get any prettier than that for his team . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench proved to be the difference in the game , as the starters failed to provide much offense . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] all finished in double figures , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] dished out var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] commanded the paint and added var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . Shot selection was key for the bench roles , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] drained var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their shots and dished out var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists . var_player[0][1][FIRST_NAME] 's assist total matched that of the entire var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] team . Isiah var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] found success attacking the rim and did most of his damage from the free throw line . The all - star point guard finished with 24 points to lead all scorers ( 5 - of - 14 FG , 12 - of - 13 FT ) and two assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] were the only other var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to join var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] in double figures , which was unsurprising given the defensive effort and size they were matched up against . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot a lowly var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and got very little production from their bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will visit the Minnesota Timberwolves ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] ) on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head north to take on the Portland Trail_Blazers ( 39 - 36 ) on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday night . The final scoreline indicates a double - digit win , but the game was tight throughout . In fact , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had an eight - point lead going into the half , but allowed 69 second half points en route to a tough loss . This was far from a defensive struggle , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot an astounding var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this game as a 17 - point underdog and did well for themselves in a close loss . They played very good offense , but just did n't do enough defensively to win the game . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][1][AST] of his best games of the season , as he collected var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] actually had five players score at least 15 points , but had no player dish out more than five assists . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] had another nice game off the bench as well , as he tallied var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][AST] assists in the defeat . It goes down as a loss in the record book , but it was a productive game from team who was expected to get blown out . It does n't get much easier in their next game though , as they host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday in their next game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been playing some spectacular ball as of late and they appear unbeatable at home . They are now 14 - 4 at the Chesapeake Arena and scoring at will . Both var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] were on point tonight and once again carried them to a win . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] flirted with a triple - double , as he amassed var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] totaled var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][AST] assists and var_player[0][0][FG3A] rebounds . When these two are playing like that , this is one of the three best teams in the NBA . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] also had a great game off the bench , tallying var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds on an efficient var_player[0][6][FGM] - of - var_player[0][6][FGA] shooting from the field and from the free - throw line . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to build off this win when they host the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at the Target Center in Minneapolis . While the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have already been eliminated from playoff contention in the Western Conference , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue to stay alive for a shot in the East . With their second win in a row , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] now sit just two and a half games behind the Indiana Pacers for the final projected playoff seed , with plenty of games left in the season to make their way back into the mix . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot really well in this game , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor , but an impressive var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . With var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] still sidelined with an ankle injury , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued to run as var_player[0][4][STL] of the starting guards for the second game in a row during Monday 's loss . He took advantage of the start once again , finishing with 20 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt ) and three assists in 31 minutes . He just recorded 18 points and var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists in Sunday 's game against the Spurs , so var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] has been making his case for extended playing time . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong showing as well though , posting 20 points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][AST] - var_player[0][3][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][3][FTM] assists in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . He 's been shooting the ball well of late , especially from the three - point line , as he 's combined to go 5 - for - 8 from beyond the arc over his last two games . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] saw some impressive contributions from the bench as well . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] had his shot locked in and scored var_player[0][6][PTS] points ( var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][6][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][AST] - var_player[0][6][FG3A] 3Pt ) in just var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][FG3A] - var_player[0][6][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[0][5][FGM] rebounds as well . Despite a season scoring average of 4 points on the year , he ' picked his game up recently and is averaging 14 points over his last four games , while playing extra minutes with so many injuries . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt did the bulk of the work for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in the win , combining for 57 points . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way , as he went var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][0][STL] - for - var_player[1][0][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][0][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][0][FG3A] rebounds in just var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes .

The Kentucky big man finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds on 8 - of - 23 shooting . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was given miles of space to shoot the ball , but shied away from the opportunity in favor of finding the open man , even if it meant threading the needle to do so . The league 's best passing point guard upped his leading assists per game statistic after registering 18 dimes , to go along with seven points and eight rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] were on the receiving end of many of var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's assists , as both front court players contributed double figures .

A pair of 3 - pointers , in addition to a driving , finger roll layup was enough to overtake the lead with just over two minutes remaining in the 4th quarter . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] added a clutch jump shot from the free throw line down the stretch and finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] dominated the glass adding var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][PTS] points .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played a pesky defensive game and saw effective performances from young players var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , as the backcourt finished with a combined 45 points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were unable to get a good look down the stretch and had no answer for var_player[0][3][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's lights out shooting , even after taking a double digit lead in the 4th quarter . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][2][PTS] points each , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] were unable to find a rhythm , finishing with var_player[1][1][FG3A] points and var_player[1][3][PTS] points , respectively . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][8][PTS] points in var_player[1][8][MIN] minutes off the bench , to go along with var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds on var_player[1][8][FGM] - of - var_player[1][8][FGA] shooting .

There was no shortage of impressive shooting in Game var_player[0][0][FTM] , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received a needed offensive explosion from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , who combined to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] at bay all game long . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] jumped out to an early lead in the first quarter , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bounced back and outscored the league 's best team in the second period var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished the first half with 25 points , and was quiet in the third quarter before returning to for a typical lights out fourth quarter showing . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] was deadly from the field , and was nearly perfect through the game , but his biggest moment came after a corner var_player[0][0][PF] , which he completed , turned to Stephen_Curry ( knee ) and stared him down as he walked back on defense late in the game . Curry sat out of practice , but is still nearing a return . Head Coach Steve Kerr said that Curry has a slight chance to play in Game 4 , but with that is dependent on the situation after Game 3 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who from the box score seemed like the game would have been closer than it was , saw var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] really step up . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] were trading threes for most of the game and both were able to finish at the rim , create off the dribble and pull up off screen and rolls . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting , while var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] stuffed the stat sheet with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( including var_player[1][1][FG3M] three - pointers ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists , var_player[1][1][STL] steal and var_player[1][1][STL] block . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in place of Curry , and the bench was kept quiet for most of the game , save for var_player[1][6][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][AST] points . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] combined for var_player[0][4][FG3_PCT] points , var_player[0][4][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][4][FGM] assists on an var_player[0][3][PTS] - of - 45 shooting . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] boards on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting and was perfect through var_player[0][0][FTA] quarters of action .

Thursday 's contest between the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] all came down to whose role players could produce more . With each team 's big three having very productive nights , the deciding factor between the two teams ended up being what everyone else could do . For the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] produced var_player[0][2][FT_PCT] points , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 77 points for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , making the trios essentially dead even . And while neither side got anything noteworthy from any other player , be it a starter or a reserve , the ability of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's role players to put up var_team[0][TEAM-REB] points to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] gave the game to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Additionally , it is worth noting that both teams rank in the bottom - half of the NBA in bench scoring per game , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ranking dead last .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , on Monday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] avoided losing back - to - back games once again , and have only lost to one opponent with a sub .500 record since the beginning of January . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] got the start for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , after playing just var_team[1][TEAM-AST] seconds in Sunday 's 87 - 82 loss at the hands of the Toronto Raptors . He logged 12 minutes this time around but was the only Spur not to score a point . Head coach Gregg Popovich reached a milestone with the victory , achieving his 1000th win . With a grand under his belt , he and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will turn their attention to the Detroit Pistons , the lone team under .500 to beat them thus far in 2015 . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] almost spoiled the party for Popovich and his former team . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] missed a var_player[0][4][FGM] - pointer with less than a second remaining that would have given his team a buzzer - beating game - winner at home . The contest had been tied when var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] gave up a var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] bucket with var_player[0][5][FTM] seconds left , leaving var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] with limited time to try and win the game .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent on 82 attempts and the teams combined for just 35 free - throws . Those are surprisingly low numbers considering the shooting percentages and it was clear the teams wanted to go to their primary identities and slow the game down to rely on their defenses . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took a 10 - point lead after the first quarter , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] really turned it on after that . In fact , they held var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to just 54 points in the final three quarters and outscored them by 25 points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into this in the second half of a back - to - back and it clearly hampered them here . They got off to a hot start , but did n't have the legs late to pull out a win against a defensively potent team . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] notoriously struggles in back - to - backs and that was the case here , as he shot just var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] to accumulate var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a nice game though , as he tallied var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds against a dominant frontline . The passing was a big problem for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] recorded just var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists in the loss . It wo n't get any easier in their next game , as they have to travel to Oakland to take on a Golden_State Warriors team that has just two losses on Monday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] got back to what they do best here and stifled the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] en route to a big win . The star of the night was var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][0][PTS] points in a fantastic performance . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] made a spot start here for the injured var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] and played great , accumulating var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][TO] blocks and var_player[0][3][STL] steals in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] got his first start in quite some time as well and swatted away var_player[0][2][BLK] shots despite failing to reach double - figures in points or rebounds . Injuries have really been hurting this team , but the more healthy they get , the scary they 're getting . This is the front end of a back - to - back , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will play the Los_Angeles Lakers on Sunday in their next game .

They tied the second quarter , with both teams scoring var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] but var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] went on to dominate the final var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] quarters and cruise to victory . The win did come at a price though as var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] left the game with an ankle tweak , and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] left after being accidentally hit in the throat . Meanwhile , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , along with var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][3][PTS] , as the var_player[1][3][FTM] combined for a modest var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] points .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] now have a var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] lead in the series and a ton of momentum following this dominating performance . With var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' defensive specialist Tony_Allen sidelined with a hamstring injury , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was able to take advantage of a lesser defeneder and lead the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to the victory . He went 7 - for - 16 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points , while also adding four rebounds and five assists . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] is dialed in from deep right now , combining to go 9 - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the three - point line over his last var_player[0][3][FG3M] games .

Defensively , the var_player[0][4][FG3M] steals marked a career playoff - high for var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] as well . Both var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] were also very effective though . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][REB] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds over var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] added an efficient var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][OREB] - var_player[0][5][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][0][FTM] assists over var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench .

The double - double was his third straight , increasing his series averages to 19 points and 10 rebounds per game . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] looked like he was going to have a solid showing after 11 points in the first quarter alone . It turned out to be the exact opposite though , as he hit just one shot the rest of the game and finished with 13 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt ) , to go along with 10 rebounds over 34 minutes . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had put up at least 15 shot attempts in seven of the first eight games of the postseason , but he 's now gone var_player[1][1][PF] straight outings with var_player[1][1][FGA] attempts or less . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[1][0][FGA] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FTA] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][PF] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[1][4][FGA] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][BLK] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] really missed Tony_Allen 's defense , as they did n't have an answer for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' hot shooting . Game six will take place on Friday in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) knocked off the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , extending their winning streak to four games .

Despite var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] points from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Friday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is on pace for the first var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - win season in the franchise 's history , and currently the team sits at second in the Eastern Conference . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] faced a tough challenge on Friday against one of the NBA 's hottest teams , but came away with the victory nontheless . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] backcourt combined for 66 points , with var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] leading the team with var_player[0][3][PTS] . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] went a ludicrous var_player[0][3][FTM] for var_player[0][3][FTA] from the free - throw line , seemingly drawing every foul en route to the team 's victory . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also came into the contest equipped with a dynamic backcourt duo , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] .

He is also averaging a career - high four assists per game through the first six contests .

It was a tale of var_player[1][0][PF] teams from the free - throw line on Friday , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( with var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's assistance ) shot over 90 percent from the charity stripe . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , did not fare as well , hitting just 65 percent of their attempts at the line .
In has n't been the prettiest 19th season for 38 - year - old power forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , and his performance in Monday 's loss against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was yet another example of that . For the second straight game , var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] failed to score in double figures , as he finished with just var_player[0][1][REB] points on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting from the field in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . He has now combined to score just 17 points and shoot 7 - of - 20 from the field over his last two games - - both of which have been losses for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . It was the 12th time this season where var_player[0][1][FIRST_NAME] has failed to score at least 10 points , and while he is n't the the same player he was in his All-Star prime , it still has had a negative impact on the team , as they are just 4 - var_player[0][1][REB] in those 12 outings .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Toyota Center on Monday . In a battle between two elite offenses , there were 249 combined points in this barn burner . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] played the hero role once again , as he hit a fastbreak lay - up with two seconds left to take the lead and eventually win the game . This matchup was close throughout , as there were 10 ties and nine lead changes , with neither team leading by more than seven points in the second half . Both teams were lights - out from the field , as they each shot over 50 percent . Turnovers really killed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they lost that battle , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - 12 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) are trying to hold on to to the eight - seed in the west and this loss is devastating for that pursuit . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he scored a career - high var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points , while also adding var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][STL] steals to his tally . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was huge off the bench , accruing var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] fell just shy of a triple - double , collecting var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists .

A var_player[0][1][FIRST_NAME] Nowtizki jumper with 1:39 to play cut the lead to just var_player[0][2][FGA] points , and a pair of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] free throws less than a minute later brought var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] within var_player[0][2][FTM] . After var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] split a pair from the line on the other end , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] responded with a long var_player[0][3][FG3A] - point jumper plus the foul to bring the Mavs within var_player[0][3][FG3A] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] smothered a var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] drive attempt with less than 10 seconds to play , but var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was able to deflect the rebound out to the perimeter , and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was forced to foul with var_player[1][4][PF] second remaining .

Leading the way was var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who shook off a recent foot injury to pour in var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FG3A] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting , including a var_player[1][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][3][FG3A] mark from three - point range .

The double - doubles should roll in with regularity this season for var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] , who recorded 48 such efforts in 2014 - 15 . Meanwhile , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hardly resembled a squad that won a franchise - best 60 games a season ago . In addition to getting very little scoring from their starting backcourt - - the trio of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] finished with just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points between them - - the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were also bullied on the interior by var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] & Co. var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] pulled down just var_player[1][2][PF] rebounds on the evening , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] held a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] edge on the glass over the night . It did n't help matters that the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lost backup big man var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] to a right ankle sprain over the course of the game .

The score would indicate a lopsided game , but it was close until the second half . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by 23 over the final var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes and much of that has to be attributed to the lights - out shooting .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's loss allows several teams to gain ground on them in the Eastern Conference playoff race . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is idle Sunday before hosting Phoenix on Monday .

He contributed a team - high var_player[0][1][FT_PCT] points ( var_player[0][1][REB] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , giving var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] his sixth double - double in seven games .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Thursday . Both teams played without key pieces , as Dwyane_Wade was forced to miss the contest due to a family matter , while Rudy_Gobert was unable to shake off the effects of the rolled ankle he suffered versus the Cavaliers on Tuesday . In their absences , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] elevated their already impressive games and put their respective teams ' offenses on their shoulders . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] filled the stat sheet with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][BLK] assists , and var_player[0][1][BLK] blocks , including a key stuff at the basket on a driving var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] late in the fourth quarter .

The fifth - year pro tallied his second consecutive 24 - point performance on a season - high 35 minutes . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] enjoyed a var_player[1][0][PTS] - point night of his own , which marked a season high in scoring for the sixth - year pro . Unfortunately for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , starting shooting guard var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other player able to score in double figures , and he barely reached the benchmark with only var_player[1][3][PTS] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dropped to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , pending the outcome of the ongoing Warriors-Timberwolves contest .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] point guard was much quieter in the second half , but did make a couple of key free throws late in the game to finish as the only other var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] player with double - digit scoring ( var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points ) . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improves to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] on the season and remains in second place behind the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They now benefit from four full days off before facing the Minnesota Timberwolves next Tuesday .
var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] played in a tightly contested game consisting of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] lead changes , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ended up needing everyone of them . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] won the game var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - 99 after NIkola var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] hit a 20 footer as time expired . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] sat out the previous three games with a bone bruise in his right knee . He did n't start the game as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] intended on easing him back into action . HIs knee is seemingly doing much better as he ended up playing 26 minutes and putting up 18 points ( 9 - 16 FG ) , five boards , two assists , one block , and one turnover . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were without Kobe_Bryant as they opted to rest him on second half of a double - header . Without him , they spread the ball around , resulting in six players scoring in double figures . var_player[1][2][FIRST_NAME] Hibert led the way with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds , four assists , and var_player[1][2][OREB] block in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to improve on their var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] record when they travel to Dallas Friday . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] was n't the only stellar performer coming from var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's bench . Due to var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] forced to leave the game in the first quarter after suffering a concussion , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] played a season high var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . He led the team with 22 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 5 - 9 3PT , and 1 - 1 FT ) . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] welcome the Knicks into var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Saturday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] made an epic var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - 1 comeback in last seasons playoffs against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and they showed here that the comenack was no fluke by winnin a big game on the road . The demise of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was well publicized last week and it was downright wrong , as he put together another huge game on Saturday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] played this game without point guard var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] who was dealing with a groin injury and that clearly hampered them here in the loss . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] started off the season with var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - straight 20 - point losses , but they appear to be out of that swoon at this point with var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - straight wins . They have scored 110 points or more in all var_player[1][4][REB] wins and that can be attributed to var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] Hardan taking over the offense . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] is clearly back to top form , as he has dropped 89 points over the last var_player[1][4][AST] nights . This was the second half of a back - to - back and it 's a great sign for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to see them play so well in that scenario against a team like the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . They even got to rest var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] on Friday night and that proved to be crucial for this game , as he tallied var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][PTS] rebounds in the win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will have a few days off and look to keep that winning - streak alive against the winless Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday , The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had to play this game without their point guard var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] and it was just too difficult for them to function fully without their playmaker . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] filled in for var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] and put up var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][BLK] assist in the loss . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who totaled var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists in the loss . One stat that coach Doc var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] will love is that all var_player[0][4][PTS] players who played more than a single a minute in this game recorded an assist in the absence of assist - master var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] . The next game on tap for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] is against the struggling Memphis Grizzlies on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have undoubtedly observed that the Sixers ( 18 - 34 ) seem to be a different team from seasons past , when their presence on a schedule almost guaranteed a win . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has been most effective at home , where they 've managed a 12 - 15 record . It was therefore no surprise that it took double - digit scoring from all five var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starters and success rates of over var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the field and three - point range for the visitors to tough out a win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were unable to truly separate from their hosts at any point , as the Sixers battled impressively despite the continued absence of var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] also was buoyed by the return of var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who had missed Monday 's contest against the Grizzlies with a quad injury . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][DREB] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and a rebound . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[1][1][PTS] - point , var_player[1][1][FGA] - rebound double - double that also included a pair of blocks . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[1][3][PTS] points and supplemented them with var_player[1][3][FG3M] rebounds and a pair of steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] supplied a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][2][FTA] assists and a block . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][PF] rebound and var_player[1][8][DREB] assist . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] turned in matching var_player[0][2][PTS] - point efforts to pace the Sixers . The former added three assists and one rebound , while the latter registered eight boards and a pair of blocks . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][OREB] assist and var_player[0][0][STL] steals . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was back on the bench but contributed var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[0][5][FG3A] assists over var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][1][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][PF] assists , var_player[0][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][STL] steal .

This was one of the tightest games of the season , as there were 11 ties and 11 lead changes in this overtime thriller . In addition , neither team led by more than eight points , as it was full of swings . Defense was key for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as they held the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to under var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting , while forcing them to commit var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . In addition , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent , while committing just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . Bench production was a huge factor too , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] winning that battle , 35 - 16 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - 12 ) have now won six - straight games , as they continue to vie for the top - seed in the west . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] once again carried the load , as he tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][DREB] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other starter in double figures , totaling var_player[1][1][PTS] points , 15 rebounds and var_player[1][1][PF] blocks . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][7][AST] assists and var_player[1][5][AST] steals , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] contributed 12 points , var_player[1][5][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][7][STL] assists off the pine as well . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will host the Minnesota Timberwolves for their next game on Saturday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][2][REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have yet to find their rhythm with var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , as this marks their fourth - straight loss with him in the lineup . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , nine rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other Pelican in double figures , collecting var_player[0][2][PTS] points , 23 rebounds and var_player[0][2][OREB] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will return to action on Saturday in a road matchup with the Los_Angeles Lakers .

In an all - around dominant performance , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] used a strong second half , where they out - scored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 59 - 39 , to finish off the var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - point victory in front of their home crowd . They shot extremely well in this one , going 53 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and a meager var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . With the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hitting var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] more three - pointers than the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , they had little to no chance of making a comeback Tuesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got a ridiculous amount of production from their bench , as their bench out - scored the Magics 73 - 18 . That effort was led by var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who went var_player[0][5][FGM] - for - var_player[0][5][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][5][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][5][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a game - high of var_player[0][5][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][5][FG3M] rebounds and var_player[0][5][AST] assists . It was a new season - high in points for the guard , who 's now averaging 19 points and 4 assists over his last six games . Joining var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] off the bench was var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] , who recorded var_player[0][8][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][REB] - var_player[0][8][FGA] FG , var_player[0][8][FTM] - var_player[0][8][OREB] FT ) and var_player[0][8][REB] rebounds in just var_player[0][8][MIN] minutes . It marked just his fourth double - double of the season and first since the start of February . He 's now averaging 9 points and 6 rebounds on the year . Making just his second career start , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was forced into the starting lineup , after CJ_Miles was a late scratch with a foot injury . He took advantage of the start , hitting nearly everything he shot and finished with 17 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 5 - 7 3Pt ) , to go along with five assists . It marked just his sixth time this season reaching double - digit points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][4][AST] assists as well . Doing the best he could to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] close in this game was var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who went off for var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][REB] FT ) , var_player[1][0][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][0][STL] assists in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . He 's picked his game up of late , and is averaging 21 points and 5 rebounds over his last three games . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] struggled offensively in this var_player[1][3][TO] , and scored just var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FGM] FT ) , while adding var_player[1][3][BLK] steals and var_player[1][3][BLK] blocked shots . He recorded over 20 points in each of his last four games , so it was a disappointing performance for the guard . Rookie var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was in double figures for his third straight game , as he finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][AST] FT ) , to go along with var_player[1][4][AST] assists . Over that three - game stretch , he 's averaging 14 points , 6 rebounds and 8 assists , as he 's done a little bit of everything for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] during that span . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][PF] - var_player[1][2][AST] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Wednesday .
var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] exploded for a massive var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][2][OREB] assists , var_player[1][2][STL] steals and a block , but it was n't enough to overcome a similarly impressive var_player[0][3][PTS] - point outing from var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] that included var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] and var_player[1][2][OREB] - of - var_player[0][3][FG3M] tallies from the field and three - point range , respectively . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] registered a var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][AST] - assist double - double while also hauling in eight rebounds , but he committed a game - high var_player[0][4][TO] turnovers . Otto_Porter and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 25 points and 15 rebounds , while var_player[0][8][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] , Jr. led the bench with a var_player[0][8][PTS] - point , var_player[0][8][PTS] - rebound double - double . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was next behind var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points but the rest of the starting var_player[1][2][TO] fell short on the stat sheet , as var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] combining for just 13 points . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with a var_player[1][6][PTS] - point effort .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Verizon Center on Sunday . The contest was a battle of two surging squads , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) having checked in to Sunday on a four - game win streak , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) having prevailed in four of their previous five contests as well . The high - scoring affair was befitting of two teams on the rise , and was tightly - contested through all four quarters . Ultimately , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's season - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points , which came on the strength of a var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting tally from the field , as well as a var_player[0][3][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][3][FG3A] mark from three - point range , was too much for the visitors to overcome . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had the hot hand for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] as well , going var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the floor on his way to var_player[0][1][PTS] points . The two stellar offensive efforts led to impressive success rates of 53 percent and 53 percent from the field and three - point range , respectively , for the hosts . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] saw var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][1][PTS] points lead the way , a total he supplemented with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and a steal . J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] checked in a rather distant second with var_player[1][3][PTS] points and a rebound . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a pair of var_player[1][2][PTS] - point performances that were part of double - doubles . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] also dished out var_player[1][4][AST] assists and recorded var_player[1][4][PF] rebounds and a pair of steals , while var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] hauled in var_player[1][2][REB] boards , handed out var_player[1][2][AST] assists and posted a block . Mareese var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[1][7][PTS] points , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , back on the bench due to the surprising return of var_player[1][0][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] a Moute from a shoulder injury , contributed var_player[1][5][PTS] points . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][REB] assists and a steal to his aforementioned game - high scoring haul . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] supplemented his var_player[0][1][PTS] points with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][FTA] assists , var_player[0][1][STL] steals and a block . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] registered an var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][AST] - assist double - double that also featured var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , a steal and a block . Otto_Porter and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] contributed matching var_player[0][2][PTS] - point tallies , with the former adding var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][2][TO] assists and three steals , and the latter supplying var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , a steal and var_player[0][2][OREB] blocks . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] travel to Indiana for a Monday evening date with the Pacers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , on Monday . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was removed from the game with a left thumb injury in the second quarter and did n't return . He had 10 points and two steals in 14 minutes before he exited . In var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's absence , var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had to pick up the slack . They combined for 14 points and nine rebounds off the bench to help out the short - handed frontcourt that is already missing Robin_Lopez ( hand ) and Joel_Freeland ( shoulder ) . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] came back strong for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] after missing Saturday 's game against the Clippers with an ankle injury . He finished with 22 points , 19 rebounds , and four blocks . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a nice game with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . After coming off the bench Saturday , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] returned to the starting lineup and shot var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field for var_player[1][0][PTS] points . var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] was available to play but did n't get into the action .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head home to face the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Phoenix to face the Suns .
Despite the lopsided scoreline , this game was close until the final minutes . In fact , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ended the game on a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 8 run to eventually win by var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] . Shooting was the key difference , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] surpassed 50 percent from both the field and three - point range , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] barely cracked var_team[0][TEAM-REB] percent from the field and 30 percent from three - point range . var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] Schroeder was the player of the game , accumulating var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] also had a nice all - around game , collecting var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][FG3A] steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double against his former team .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] ) defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , Friday evening at Time Warner Cable Arena . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] led the whole way in this one , after a very strong , 69 - 53 first half . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fought back , bringing it to a five - point game late in the third , but could never gain the lead . With this win the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have now won six in a row for the first time in six seasons , and have also won seven in a row at home , where their record is now a solid 24 - 9 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into this one winners of their last two games but had their win streak cut short , and their grip on eighth in the East loosened , as they came in only half a game ahead of Chicago . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was relatively quiet as he failed to record 30 points , a feat which he accomplished in his four previous games . Instead , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][FG3M] rebound and var_player[0][4][DREB] steal , in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . Six other players scored in double digits for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , more than compensating for var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's quiet game . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the high - point man for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as he finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][DREB] - var_player[0][1][PF] FT ) , along with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] logged a double - double as he added var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][AST] assists , along with var_player[0][0][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[0][0][STL] steals , in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did a good job at the foul line , hitting 24 - 29 free throws and shot a solid var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong game for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , finishing with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][DREB] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FG3M] rebounds , in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][TO] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FG3A] - var_player[1][3][FTM] FT ) , in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][PF] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTA] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][0][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][3][TO] steals and var_player[1][0][AST] assist , in 34 minutes . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] made his return to the lineup after being out with a shoulder injury that he suffered on February 22nd . var_player[1][9][SECOND_NAME] logged var_player[1][9][MIN] minutes , during which he contributed var_player[1][9][PTS] points ( var_player[1][9][FG3M] - var_player[1][9][FG3A] 3Pt ) . Next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head straight to Philly to play the third game of their current four - game road trip , on Saturday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to extend their overall win streak and also their home win streak as they host the Rockets on Saturday .
While the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have lost var_player[1][0][OREB] of their last var_player[1][0][FG3M] games , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] has been carrying the load for them offensively and on the glass . Tuesday 's loss to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was yet another example of the swingman putting his offensive and rebounding prowess on display . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished Tuesday 's game with a team - high var_player[1][0][FGA] points and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , and it was his third straight game with a double - double from points and rebounds . He 's now averaging 23 points and 10 rebounds over those three contests . Across from var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] on Tuesday , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] notched a double - double of his own , scoring var_player[1][0][FGA] points and grabbing a game - high var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds . For var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , however , this is a less common occurrence , with Tuesday being his first double - double since late January . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] is also on pace this season to have the lowest rebounding averaging of his career since his 2005 - var_player[0][0][FG3A] campaign when he averaged just var_player[0][0][FTA] per game .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at United Center on Friday evening . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have been one of the NBA 's best squads all season , and a great deal of their success is rightfully attributed to their prolific offense . Typically , it 's the spectacular efforts of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] that spearhead the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] attack , but Friday 's path to victory was a bit of a departure from the norm . It was the returning var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who 'd missed the team 's tilt against the Jazz on Wednesday with a back injury , that led the way with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FTM] steal . Additionally , a stellar defensive effort , one that saw var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] limit their hosts to success rates of 39 percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] percent from three - point range , while also forcing them into 18 turnovers , that was pivotal to the win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also outscored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) by a whopping 69 - 30 margin over the second and third periods , sealing the win before the fourth quarter even began . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was second behind var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steals . He left the game late in the first quarter for a time after getting his foot stepped on but ultimately returned . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] boards and var_player[1][2][AST] assist . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] turned in an var_player[1][0][REB] - point , var_player[1][0][PTS] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][0][AST] assist and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][7][PF] assist , var_player[1][7][FG3M] steals and var_player[1][7][BLK] block . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in his return from a var_player[0][3][PF] - game absence due to a thigh injury , as he collected var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][FTM] assists and var_player[0][3][FTA] steals . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FTM] assists and var_player[0][0][PF] steal . var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][11][PTS] points , var_player[0][11][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[0][11][PF] assists and var_player[0][11][STL] steal . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] produced var_player[0][7][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][7][STL] steal , while var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] all matched var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] ' point total off the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remain home and await the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] make the trek to Beantown for a Sunday afternoon showdown with the Boston Celtics .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) continued their great play on Monday , defeating the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . This appeared to be a mismatch on paper and that came to fruition on Monday . The second quarter was when the tides turned , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] scored var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points in that 12 - minute stretch while holding the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to just var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] . The benches were a big difference as well , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] reserves scored 56 points to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-AST] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this game as a huge favorite and did what they do . While they did n't play the elite defense they are known for , they blitzed them with efficient offense and ran away with yet another blowout win . Tony_Parker sat out this game , but everyone stepped up in his absence . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with 23 points and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] put in an impressive double - double . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was coming off his first scoreless performance in his 19 - year career , to post var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists in a great all - around game . This team just continues to impress and they 'll look to extend their 20 - game winning streak at home on Wednesday against the Utah Jazz in their next fixture . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was supposed to have one of the best defenses in the NBA this season , but they continued their poor defense in this game . They allowed at least var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in every single quarter and allowed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to shoot over 55 percent from the field . The bench was especially bad , as no player scored more than var_player[0][6][FGA] points aside from var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] who scored just var_player[0][6][PTS] . All five starters scored in double - figures , but it simply was n't enough against a potent offense like the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . In fact , all five starters tallied at least 11 points , three rebounds and two assists in a great team effort . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will have to travel to Chicago for Tuesday 's matchup against the Bulls in a rivalry game .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . After a big fourth quarter from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , the var_player[1][1][TO] teams went down to the wire , changing leads three times in the last var_player[1][4][FG3A] minutes before an var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] dunk and var_player[1][4][FG3A] free throws from var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] sealed the deal for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] led the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , posting var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] FG , var_player[1][1][BLK] - var_player[1][1][PF] 3Pt ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes of play . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] recorded a double - double in the winning effort of var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][STL] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FG , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FT ) , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][DREB] steals in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes as well . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the other var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starter to score in double figures , finishing with var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] points ( var_player[1][0][FG3A] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][PF] - var_player[1][0][FGM] 3Pt ) , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and four assists in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was also huge for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] off the bench , scoring var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][AST] - var_player[1][6][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FTM] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] FT ) and grabbing var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . Paul_Millsap was out once again with a shoulder injury , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] got the start in his place , but he had just var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG ) in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . The win brings var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] just one game away from 60 wins on the year with just four games remaining in the regular season . They have already locked up the number one seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , as he has grown a habit of doing , led the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , scoring var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTA] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) and grabbing var_player[0][2][FTM] rebounds in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . Over his last var_player[0][2][AST] games now , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] has put up 58 points and 19 rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was not too far behind var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] , scoring var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FGM] 3Pt ) and grabbing var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds , but he missed the potential game - tying var_player[0][0][AST] at the end of regulation . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also continues to play well , posting a double - double of var_player[0][4][FGA] points and var_player[0][1][FGA] assists , while var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also recorded a double - double of var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][7][PTS] ) and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) round out the six var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' players who scored in double figures . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were hot coming into Wednesday 's matchup as winners of seven of their last eight , and while they are still winners of seven of their last nine , both those losses came at the hands of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Regardless , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] still find themselves in the playoffs and hold a one - game lead over the Pacers and Heat for the final spot in the East . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head home Friday to take on the Hornets , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will stay home Friday and play the Wizards .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in overtime on Wednesday . The game was a tale of two halves , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] building a 50 - 40 lead by intermission , largely on the strength of a second period in which they outscored the visitors var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - 19 . However , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came out of the locker room ready to play catch - up in the third period , and clawed all the way back to take a 91 - 89 lead on a var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] layup with 31 seconds remaining in regulation . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] then made a clutch driving layup for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] at the var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - second mark to knot things up at 91 . Following var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] ' missed 30 - foot three - point attempt with var_player[1][3][FG3M] second remaining , the contest went into the extra period . `` var_player[0][3][FIRST_NAME] Buckets `` was the hero again for the home team in the `` fifth quarter `` by notching var_player[0][3][DREB] points , including a game - winning tip - in with var_player[0][3][BLK] seconds remaining to seal the hard - fought victory . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' attack was spearheaded by var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued his recent string of sluggish performances , collecting var_player[1][1][PTS] points on var_player[1][1][FGM] of var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting , including var_player[1][1][FTA] of var_player[1][1][FG3A] from three - point range . It was notably the fifth time in the last six games that var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] shot under 40 percent from the field , and the tenth time overall in December . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was able to pitch in var_player[1][3][PTS] points and add var_player[1][0][FGM] assists , a rebound and a pair of steals , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] posted a double - double in a rare start , collecting var_player[1][0][PTS] points and hauling in var_player[1][0][REB] boards . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] reserves with a var_player[1][5][PTS] - point outing . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and into third place behind the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home for a New Year 's Eve showdown with the Milwaukee Bucks . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] finished with an outstanding var_player[0][3][PTS] points , and added var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][DREB] assists , var_player[0][3][TO] steals and a block . He notably visited the free - throw line 13 times , draining 11 of those attempts successfully . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a relatively subdued but efficient double - double with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . He also added var_player[0][3][PF] blocks and a sole assist , which came on var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's game - winning shot . While no other starter was able to get into double - digits scoring - wise , two very productive performances off the bench were crucial to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's cause . With var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] sitting with a sore hamstring , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] showed he had the hot hand early despite yielding the start to var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , and ended up playing a robust var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] tallied a season - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points , and was successful on var_player[0][5][FG3M] of his var_player[0][5][FG3A] three - point tries . While he did turn the ball over six times , he provided some badly - needed scoring punch in var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] 's stead . 2015 first - round pick var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] also pitched in significantly off the bench with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds , a steal and a block . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and are now in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division.They remain home for a New Year 's Day matchup against the Knicks .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at the Staples Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Down var_player[0][3][REB] with just over 30 seconds left in the game , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] knocked down a contested var_player[0][3][FGM] - pointer to pull within var_player[0][3][FGM] . After var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] blocked var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] on the other side , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had a shot at another var_player[0][3][FGM] - pointer to tie the game , but missed it as time expired , giving the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] their second loss in as many games . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] started this game , but had to leave after only 14 minutes as he suffered a mild left hamstring strain . He still finished with four points , five rebounds and five assists . With var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] out of the game , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] took over , scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][OREB] - var_player[1][4][PF] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FGA] - var_player[1][4][FTA] ) , while adding var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][FGM] steals . It was the first time he 's reached double figures in points since mid - December , so it was good to see him show an improved offensive game Tuesday . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] did n't have his best game , as he struggled with his shot and scored only var_player[1][2][REB] points ( var_player[1][2][FG3A] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTA] - var_player[1][2][FGM] 3Pt ) . It was the first time in 21 games that he did n't reach double - digit points . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] continued to impress , scoring var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][REB] FG ) and grabbing var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . Over his last two games he 's averaged 19 points and 13 rebounds , despite averaging only 7 points and 6 rebounds on the year . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't really have anyone standout in the loss . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a rough night , shooting only var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][TO] - for - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from the three - point line to finish with var_player[0][3][PTS] points . He did have six rebounds and seven assists though , so that at least helped offset his poor shooting performance . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) of his own , while adding var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds as well . He was right on par with his season averages of 12 points and 8 rebounds . The only other Laker to reach double figures in points was var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who went var_player[0][1][FGM] - for - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the field to score var_player[0][1][PTS] points in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . He also had eight rebounds . After recording only three points on Sunday , it was a nice bounce back game for him . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's next game will be on the road against the Golden_State Warriors on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) snapped a seven - game losing streak with a decisive var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] win over the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) on Wednesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was finally able to turn its luck around on Wednesday , as the team maintained a firm lead over var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for the final three quarters . Point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , and also provided a strong defensive performance as he stole the ball var_player[0][4][STL] times . Backup var_player[0][5][FIRST_NAME] Lim provided a valuable spark off the bench for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as he poured in var_player[0][5][PTS] points and went var_player[0][5][FTA] - for - var_player[0][5][FTM] from the free - throw line . With center Al_Jefferson ( meniscus ) still out , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was able to shine in his starting role , posting a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double along with var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] simply dominated every aspect of the game , out - rebounding var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] and shooting 7 percent better from the field . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who came into the game well - rested and holding onto first place in the Southeast Division , simply could not make anything happen in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . All-Star forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the only Hawk to score in double - digits , as he led the team with var_player[1][1][PTS] points . Overall , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] struggled from the field , shooting just var_team[1][TEAM-REB] percent on the night . In what was an unusual issue for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , a team known for its ball movement , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held a var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] advantage in team assists . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to get the ball moving better in a Friday night matchup against Milwaukee . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , will hope that its luck has changed for good , as it prepares to take on New_Orleans on Friday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has won their last two games , defeating the Toronto Raptors 129 - 122 in overtime Sunday before going on the road to beat the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a dubious triple - double to encore the 31 - point , var_player[1][3][FGA] - rebound and var_player[1][3][PTS] - assist line he put up Sunday . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][TO] turnovers Tuesday . His barrage of assists have been accompanied by wins for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , but var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] has put on passing clinics in small stretches before that faded quickly in the past , indicating that he will likely regress back to being more of a scoring threat than a facilitator most nights . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have two more games on their road trip , and they 'll finish a back - to - back set Wednesday when they go to Washington to take on the Wizards . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has dropped nine straight games . Over their last var_player[0][5][OREB] contests , they 've used var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench and shifted var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] to power forward so they could add an extra shooter on the wing . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] has started at small forward both gmes , but after he played just var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes Tuesday , it appears his hold on the job may not be too tight . While defense is n't the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' forte , they were successful in limiting the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is playing a back - to - back set , and they 'll travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . In a surprise performance , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to take down one of the best teams in their conference , while notching their third straight victory as well . They were the superior shooters in this one , going 45 percent from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also secured a hefty advantage on the boards , as they out - rebounded the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] , which may have made the biggest difference in their var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - point win on the road in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . As they 've done all season long , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] did the bulk of the work offensively . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field , but missed all var_player[1][0][FG3A] of his three - point attempts , to finish with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , while adding var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists as well . He 's been absolutely awful from deep over his last five games , going a combined 2 - for - 20 from the three - point line during that stretch , but he was able to overcome the poor shooting and still finish above his season scoring average of 20 points per game . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , posted var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][REB] FT ) of his own , to go along with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][STL] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocked shots . He 's stepped it up offensively of late , averaging 19 points and 9 rebounds over his last four games . He 's also posted three blocks in each of his last three games . Notching one of his more impressive lines of his season , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] reobunds in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . He looks to be getting more and more comfortable as a member of the starting lineup , posting a double - double in three of his last four games . The rebounds were a season - high . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][8][PTS] points ( var_player[1][8][FGM] - var_player[1][8][FTM] FG , var_player[1][8][TO] - var_player[1][8][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][8][FGA] - var_player[1][8][FTA] FT ) in var_player[1][8][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had the strongest performance of all the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' starters . He went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 2 - for - 7 from the three - point line to finish with 18 points , while adding five rebounds as well . One of the more inconsistent players on this team , it was one of his better nights , as he averages just 11 points per game on the season . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] also did everything he could to keep the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in this game , as he recorded var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FGM] FT ) and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . He 's had a nice stretch of two games , combining for 44 points and 19 rebounds over that span . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures as well , posting var_player[0][4][FGA] points of his own , but he seemed to struggle with his shot , going just var_player[0][4][AST] - of - var_player[0][4][PTS] from the field and var_player[0][4][FG3_PCT] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from deep . Coming off the bench , rookie var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][6][PTS] points ( var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][6][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][BLK] - var_player[0][6][PF] 3Pt ) in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . The points were a new season - high for the rookie . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] guaranteed themselves a var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - win season with this victory and it came in relatively easy fashion . The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] recording seven more assists than the Sixers , while committing var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] less turnovers . Philadlephia could n't keep their hands out of the cookie jar , as they committed 25 fouls and allowed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to go 33 - of - 39 from the free - throw line . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][FGM] rebounds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was arguably their best player , as he collected var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][FGM] steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was dominant in 14 minutes , as he totaled var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][FGM] rebounds on var_player[1][2][REB] - of - var_player[1][2][FGM] shooting . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued his surge , as he led Philly with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][STL] steals .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . Both teams started the day with key starters listed as questionable for the contest , and only one ended up making it on the court . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] was unable to take the floor with his back injury , but var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] shook off the effects of a bruised shin to suit up for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . However , by game 's end it was the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] who had overcome their missing component , as former starter var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] stepped in admirably and provided a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double . He also added a steal and a block . Meanwhile , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was able to play var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes , but struggled with his shot . The 2015 first - rounder tallied 14 points on 6 - for - 18 shooting , and was only able to drain one of his four three - point attempts . Joseph var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] paced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with a var_player[1][1][PTS] - point , var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - rebound double - double , which also included an assist and a steal . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was able to battle through his perennially sore shoulder for a second straight night , amassing var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and a block . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][4][REB] assists , var_player[1][4][TO] rebounds , a steal and var_player[1][4][TO] blocks . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , three rebounds and a pair of assists . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the reserves with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][FG3A] assists , var_player[1][5][FG3M] rebounds and a steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head back home to face the Denver Nuggets on Friday night . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] spearheaded the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' attack with a game - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points , and he added var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][FTM] rebounds , a steal and a block . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists , var_player[0][4][BLK] blocks and a steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] filled out the stat sheet with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and a steal . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] bench with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][AST] assists , a rebound and a steal . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They hit the road for a date with the Sacramento Kings on Friday night .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 9 ) held off the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in an overtime thriller on Sunday . This was a a very close game throughout , until the overtime . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] scored var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] unanswered points and held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to just two points in the extra five minutes . The worst part about that is that the one basket for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came with less than var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] seconds left , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] allowed a meaningless uncontested layup . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the hero , as he tallied 29 points after the halftime buzzer . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent on var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] attempts , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent on var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] attempts . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has played this var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] team tough twice in a row now , but just could n't come away with a win in either game . They lost both games close despite hanging around and just could n't hit any late baskets to pull off a big win . The offense and late game execution is really hurting this team right now and even with their stifling defense , they simply do n't score enough to win against teams as good as this . Three players scored at least 20 points tonight , as var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] all played well . It does n't get much easier , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to San_Antonio to take on a Spurs team that is undefeated at home this season . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have now won nine of their last 11 games and their two superstars are playing brilliantly right now . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] was white - hot here , catching fire in the second half for 29 points . He finished the game with 31 points , five rebounds and six assists in the win . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was great as well , as he accumulated var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had just var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , but recorded var_player[0][1][BLK] blocks and made some huge stuffs at the end to seal the win . When all three of these guys are playing their roles to perfection , it 's hard to see anyone keeping up with them . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to keep this hot stretch going against the Portland Trail_Blazers on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Spectrum Center on Saturday night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) checked into Saturday having played very well over their past two weeks , but also burning the proverbial candle at both ends . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had already played 13 games since the All-Star break , and had n't enjoyed two consecutive days off since just before the extended layoff . That pace was bound to catch up with them at some point , and it may have well been Saturday night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] appeared a bit sluggish on offense , with their final scoring tally representing their lowest since Feb. 26 . They shot just 37 percent from the field and 33 percent from three - point range while also turning the ball over 12 times . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were able to capitalize on their visitors ' fatigue in the second half , when they outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by a 59 - 53 margin to pull off the home victory . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with a modest var_player[1][4][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][4][OREB] steal . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] boards , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][3][STL] steal and var_player[1][3][STL] block . Otto_Porter , Jr. followed with 16 points , three rebounds , one assist and three steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] drew another start for Markieff_Morris ( illness ) and provided var_player[1][1][FGA] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][FG3A] blocks . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][PF] rebounds and var_player[1][6][AST] assist . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] paced var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][STL] steals and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] supplied matching var_player[0][4][PTS] - point efforts , with the former adding var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][FG3M] rebounds and the latter registering var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] steals . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] returned after a multi - game absence due to migraines and tallied var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] III paced the reserves with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][FGM] boards , var_player[0][6][PF] assists and var_player[0][6][OREB] block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was productive off the bench as well with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][AST] assists and var_player[0][5][FG3M] rebound . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] next head to Boston for key showdown with the Celtics on Monday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Monday evening as well .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at the Staples Center . With var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] sidelined and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] struggling at the free throw line , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was the hero for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Thursday . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][FG3M] assists in 30 minutes off the bench . It was a back - and - fourth affair throughout , especially in the fourth quarter . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] used the hack - a - var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] approach on var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] to the tune of var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] attempting var_player[0][2][FTA] free throws , making only var_player[0][2][FTM] of them . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is comfortably in playoff position , but missed an opportunity to steal a win on the road to gain ground in the West . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a big performance with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] looked good with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have another big test Friday on their nine - game road swing as they will travel to Oakland to take on the Warriors . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has now won three straight without var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] after holding off var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] on Thursday . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] narrowly missed out on another 20 - 20 game as he finished with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] boards . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had a big game as well with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists over var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to continue their winning streak on Saturday against the Kings .
With Tony_Parker battling a foot injury , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] decided to look at rookie var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] to take over the starting point guard duties in order to leave var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] in his role off the bench . And in his last var_player[1][4][FTA] starts in Parker 's absence , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has already been impressive . Following his performance of var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in Tuesday 's victory over the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] is now averaging var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds per game over his last var_player[1][4][FTA] starts , which included a career - high var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] points in last Thursday 's victory over the Nuggets . That is more points and rebounds than Parker 's averages this season , and while it is a small sample size , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's production at just var_team[1][TEAM-AST] years old not only gives the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] insurance for this year 's championship run , but for every var_player[1][4][BLK] in the future as well .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at TD Garden on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) checked into Wednesday scoring the third - least points per game in the league ( 95 ) , and that trend would rear its ugly head yet again against a var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] squad that was ranked in the bottom var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] in points allowed . Playing once again without Dirk_Nowitzki ( Achilles ) , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] got precious little production from anyone not named var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] or var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] . The two players combined for just over 60 percent of the team 's point total , and the Mavs managed just a 42 percent success rate from the field overall . Meanwhile , although the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][4][AST] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) did n't have much more offensive balance on their end , they benefited greatly from a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , with 22 of those coming in the fourth quarter . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , but could n't contribute much else in the non - scoring categories , posting var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds , an assist and var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] steals . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] drained var_player[1][3][FG3M] - of - var_player[1][3][FG3A] three - point attempts on his way to var_player[1][3][PTS] points , and he added var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][STL] steals . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] notably was scoreless over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes in his return from a multi - game absence due to a calf injury , while J.J.Barea paced the reserves with nine points , six assists , var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds and a steal over 28 minutes in his stead . Both var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] had to leave the game with injuries and were unable to return . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][AST] dimes and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds to his scoring total . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] posted an var_player[0][3][PTS] - point , var_player[0][3][REB] - rebound double - double that also included an assist . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] drew another start in place of Al_Horford ( concussion ) at power forward , totaling var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] boards over var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] filled out the stat sheet with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][STL] steals . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have their own Friday showdown at home against the Golden_State Warriors .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Staples Center on Thursday . In a battle between a young team and a veteran bunch , the elders were able to escape with a much needed victory . It was the third quarter in which the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took control , as they outscored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] , after trailing by double - digits in the first half . Strangely enough , there was only one tie and two lead changes , as that one momentum swing was extremely decisive . The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] offense was on point , as they shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent from the free - throw line and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . They also dominated the rebounding and assists , as they won the rebounding differential , 42 - 34 and the assist battle , 24 - 15 . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had just three road wins coming into this matchup , but they showed some serious fight in the second half to get that tally to four . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the catalyst of the offense , as he dished out var_player[1][4][AST] assists to go along with his var_player[1][4][PTS] points before fouling out in the final seconds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] went just var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field , but finished with var_player[1][1][FGA] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists in the win . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , as he dropped var_player[1][3][PTS] points to add to his var_player[1][3][FGM] boards . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to score var_player[1][6][PTS] points a piece.The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have a tough task ahead of them , as they play the Golden_State Warriors on Friday for their next game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) continues to falter , as they 've now lost var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] of their last var_team[0][TEAM-AST] games . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , as he accrued var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was lights out shooting , as he scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points on var_player[0][3][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][3][FGM] from three - point range . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] went just var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field , but accumulated var_player[0][4][FGA] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 25 points off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will return to action on Sunday in a home matchup against the Toronto Raptors . This marks the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 12th - straight win over the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) went on the road and knocked off the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday night at the US Airways Center . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] finally got over the hump , snapping their 13 - game losing streak against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Friday . They were led by a well - rounded team effort in which six players scored in double figures . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the leader of the pack though , as he scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][REB] FG , var_player[1][2][PF] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) to go with var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds , var_player[1][2][STL] assist , var_player[1][2][STL] steal and var_player[1][2][STL] block in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] posted a double - double of his own , scoring var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][OREB] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][TO] FT ) to go with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds .

The Cavs and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have played three games against each other already this season , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] taking their first matchup and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] taking the last two . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] took on the scoring load Tuesday , finishing with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] facilitated and finished with a double - double of var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . Mike_Miller has missed the last three games with a concussion . Tuesday was the earliest he could have returned , but he was n't ready . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has dropped two of their last three games , both losses coming against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . DeMar_DeRozan 's absence with an adductor injury is having a noticeable impact on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . They used var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] as the fill - in starter at shooting guard for the first var_player[1][9][PF] games DeRozan was out , but they opted to move var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] back to the bench and insert var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] into the starting lineup Tuesday to try and put a bigger player on the wing to guard var_player[0][8][FIRST_NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took the game down to the wire , with var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds ) and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists ) both putting up double - doubles , but their quality performances were n't enough to put the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] over the top .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at Talking Stick Arena on Monday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are banged up , but they are still finding ways to pull out tough victories and hold on to the 5 - seed in the Western Conference . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] would normally be an easy matchup for the physical var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] style of play , but it took the backcourt some time to get warm before eventually closing out the game late in the fourth quarter . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was ahead for most of the first half , and extended a lead into double figures midway through the second quarter , however , they were unable to hold onto their lead with the game tied with under one minute remaining in regulation . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] put back a missed layup to take a var_player[1][6][REB] point lead , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did the rest of their damage from the free throw line to close out . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] recently signed var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] to a 10 day contract , and the signing looked to be a positive var_player[1][8][AST] after var_player[1][8][SECOND_NAME] saw 22 minutes off the bench and added var_player[1][8][PTS] points on var_player[1][8][FG3A] - of - var_player[1][8][FGA] shooting , including var_player[1][8][FTA] clutch free throws down the stretch . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] continues to see starting minutes , and although his shot selection was iffy ( var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting ) , he did complete var_player[1][4][AST] assists and add var_player[1][4][FTM] steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] has become the go - to scorer for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , and continued to be a monster on the glass , as he finished with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds . The aforementioned var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] led all var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] scorers with var_player[1][6][PTS] points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are amongst the bottom four teams in the league and will towards a lottery pick in the draft , but they played a spirited game , one which they were in control to win up until the final two minutes of play . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued their volume shooting , but they were far from efficient , as they combined for 31 points on 9 - of - 30 shooting . Turnovers proved to be the difference maker in the fourth quarter , where the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] added two miscues in crunch time . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] suffered another setback after var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( back ) left Monday 's game with back spasms after logging var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][FGM] rebound in 13 minutes of action . Both teams face the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 14 - 55 ) next , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] visit Staples Center on Tuesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] host Kobe_Bryant and company on Wednesday .

Even though their shooting was n't as crisp as usual - - var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor , var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point land - - var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] still ran efficient offense , as they assisted on var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] of their 39 made field goals ( 77 percent ) and turned the ball over just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] times . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] made 14 of 45 three - pointers ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) and attempted fewer two - pointers ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] ) than threes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] notched var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds in addition to leading all scorers with var_player[1][4][MIN] points on an absurdly efficient var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting night , including var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from var_player[1][4][FTA] . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] added var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] FG , var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3PT ) as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' starting backcourt outscored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starting guards 53 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other Warrior to reach double figures , as he scored var_player[1][0][PTS] on var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was a beast inside in the losing effort , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] center notched var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG ) , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to score var_player[0][7][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FTA] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG ) in just var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes , and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points and added var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists . But the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] just could n't find their shot , as they made just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their field goals and shot 10 - 34 ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) from three - point land . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue their road trip Wednesday against the Heat . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] welcome the Bulls for a Friday contest .
var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is not accustomed to being held to var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] points on var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting , but they have n't seen a defense like the one var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] possesses . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] actually ranked first in the NBA with under var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] points a game allowed and that number surely dropped here . var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] Schroeder was the only starter to play well for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as he scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points on an inefficient var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the player of the game for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as he dropped var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points and var_player[0][0][FTM] rebounds . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was n't far behind , finishing with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds . Double-doubles by var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] were huge as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defense was on display in this win , as they won the rebounding battle , var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] , and held the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starters to 37 points on under 27 percent shooting . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held the lead for the final 30 - plus minutes , as they led by 32 at times in their dominating victory .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] in double overtime on Friday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] blew a 23 - point lead Friday , but in the end , it was reserve guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] who took var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] var_player[1][4][PF] - on - var_player[1][4][FTA] on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' final offensive possession to score the game - winning layup with var_player[1][4][STL] seconds left . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] also had the game - ending defensive stop on var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] big man Kennth var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] . There was very little defense and a whole lot of offense in a game where var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had nothing to play for but pride , given that they are locked in as the No . 7 seed in the Western Conference . Given that and the length of the game , most of the starters for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were rested for both overtime periods . Despite this , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was still able to score var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG ) and grab var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds in 28 minutes , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was close behind , scoring var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt ) in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] also played well off the bench , scoring var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][AST] FG , var_player[1][6][FG3M] - var_player[1][6][FG3M] 3Pt ) and dishing out var_player[1][6][AST] assists in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . Both Chandler_Parsons ( knee ) and Rajon_Rondo ( rest ) sat out of Friday 's contest . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was absolutely on fire in the losing effort for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] points on a scorching var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting from the field , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][1][FG3A] from three and var_player[0][1][FTA] - var_player[0][1][FTA] from the free throw line in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][1][PTS] points is the most scored by a var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] player since Carmelo_Anthony dropped var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] in 2011 . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also had a monster game , scoring var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG ) and dishing out var_player[0][4][AST] assists in a game - high var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] also posted a double - double of var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][PTS] ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] ) round out all var_player[0][2][OREB] starters who scored in double figures , while var_player[1][9][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][5][PTS] points and grabbed var_player[0][2][FGA] rebounds in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench .

As a whole , the bench contributed only 12 points , although the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were still able to come out with the victory . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers in this one , nearing a triple - double with var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][BLK] - var_player[0][0][OREB] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . In the five games since he returned from his two week absence , he 's averaged 31 points as he 's been nearly unstoppable . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also had a big game , recording a double - double with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FG3A] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . It was his second double - double in a row , combining for 35 points and 25 rebounds over those two games . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] continued his strong play , recording his second double - double in a row . He finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FT_PCT] - var_player[0][3][PF] FT ) , while J.R. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][4][AST] FT ) . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] received most of their production from var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who recorded a monster line of var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . He really struggled to get anything going over his last two outings , so it was a nice bounce back game for him . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures as well , finishing with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][STL] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FG3A] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[1][0][TO] rebounds . It was n't his best game of the season , as he was averaging 19 points per game coming into Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did see some solid contribution off their bench though . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] recored var_player[1][8][PTS] points ( var_player[1][8][FGM] - var_player[1][8][FGA] FG , var_player[1][8][FTA] - var_player[1][8][PF] 3Pt , var_player[1][8][FG3M] - var_player[1][8][FG3M] FT ) , while var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] had an efficient var_player[1][9][PTS] points ( var_player[1][9][FG3M] - var_player[1][8][FGM] FG , var_player[1][9][FG3M] - var_player[1][9][FG3M] 3Pt , var_player[1][8][STL] - var_player[1][8][FG3M] FT ) .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday . Despite var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] ' well - earned reputation as the linchpin of the Cavs ' attack , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] has n't been a particularly bad second option as a source of scoring . This season , it 's been var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] who 's taken the reins of the offense over the first var_player[0][4][FG3M] games for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( 40 ) , and this was once again on display in what turned out to be a shootout against the var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . The All-Star point guard went for a team - high 32 points and added four assists and two rebounds . As has been the case in each contest , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was highly efficient with his shots , draining var_player[0][4][FGM] of var_player[0][4][FGA] attempts from the field overall and finding the net on var_player[0][4][AST] of his var_player[0][4][FG3A] three - point tries . Factoring in Tuesday 's production , the sixth - year pro has a stellar 54 percent ( 15 - for - 28 ) success rate from behind the arc over the first four games . His red - hot shooting helped the Cavs shoot 52 and 50 percent from the field and three - point range , respectively . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by a var_player[1][4][PTS] - point effort from var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , which also included var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds and a steal . The former two - guard has taken well to his new spot manning the point , already averaging 12 assists per game while still maintaining a scoring average of 35 points . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was a distant second with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][3][STL] rebounds and var_player[1][3][DREB] steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] shot well from long distance but not overall , totaling var_player[1][1][FGA] points , var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds and an assist . While the stretch - four sank four of seven three - point attempts , he was 0 - for - 5 from in front of the arc . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][0][FGA] points , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and a rebound , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] Hilario paced the reserves with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][5][FGA] assists and a block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , whose play often goes under the radar given the typical efforts of var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , continued his strong start to the season with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FTM] boards , var_player[0][1][FG3A] steals and a block . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] tallied a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[1][4][FGM] - rebound double - double and complemented it with var_player[0][0][AST] assists . After a pair of eight - point outings to start the season , J.R. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] went for double digits in the scoring column for the second straight game , collecting var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][PF] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and the duo of var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] supplied a pair of var_player[0][7][PTS] - point tallies from the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] now travel to New_York for a Wednesday night tussle with the Knicks , while the Cavs remain home and await the Boston Celtics for a Thursday night showdown .
All five starters scored in double digits for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] followed up with a solid double - double consisting of var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , to go along with var_player[0][1][AST] assists , var_player[0][1][FTM] steals and var_player[0][1][BLK] block , in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . C.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] all added var_player[0][4][PTS] points each . Other than var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' bench was quiet . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were down by two at halftime but came out and dominated the second half , outscoring the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] . Meanwhile , only var_player[1][0][FG3A] players scored in double digits for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finishing the third quarter up 68 - 66 , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to out - score var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] in the final quarter to secure a close three - point victory in a tough conference road game . While both teams finished at var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were better from the three - point line , as they shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was a force in this one , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't have much of an answer for him . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][2][FTA] - for - var_player[1][2][FGA] from the field and a perfect var_player[1][2][FTA] - for - var_player[1][2][FTM] from the free throw line to score var_player[1][2][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] is only averaging var_player[1][2][FGA] points so far this season , so it was good to see him heat up a little bit against a mostly inexperienced var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] front line . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did receive a couple of big contributions off the bench . Leading all scorers , C.J . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][5][FGM] - for - var_player[1][5][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][5][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][5][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][5][PTS] points in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . He 's now combined for 47 points over the last two games , as he 's taken it upon himself to give the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] another proven scorer . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] also had an efficient game off the bench . He had 14 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 0 - 2 FT ) and five rebounds in only 17 minutes . The only other Pacer to reach double figures in points was var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who had var_player[1][3][PTS] points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , as he went var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] continues to be var_player[0][4][PF] of the more reliable offensive threats for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and has now combined for 46 points over his last var_player[0][4][FG3M] outings . He 's averaging 18 points and 5 assists on the year . var_player[0][2][FIRST_NAME] Puchilia did everything he could to combat var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] finished with a double - double , posting var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . It was only his third double - double of the year . Also with a double - double , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench for var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] was very efficient as he did this in only var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . It was arguably his best game of the year considering he set season - highs in both points and rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Los_Angeles Lakers on Sunday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to New_York to play the Knicks on Sunday .

After a mostly dismal first two months of the season , the light appeared to come on for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in mid - January and it 's yet to be extinguished . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] rattled off victories in 14 of var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] games leading into the All-Star break , and have now begun the second half with two straight wins . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , who 've largely been heading the opposite direction lately , stumbled yet again , posting a sub - par var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate and committing var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers .

C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] provided var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds in his start at shooting guard . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] co - led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with matching var_player[0][2][PTS] - point efforts . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] also brought in var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and recorded a steal and block apiece , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][STL] rebounds and var_player[0][3][REB] steals . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed closely behind with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][PF] assists , var_player[0][4][STL] rebounds and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[0][1][STL] assist and var_player[0][1][STL] steal . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][AST] assists , var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][7][STL] steals and var_player[0][7][STL] blocks .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , which play a total of five games this week , announced before the game that both Jimmy_Butler ( illness ) and var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] ( rest ) would sit out Tuesday 's contest , which automatically made them a sizable underdog on the road against a var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) squad that was at full strength . However , it was clear from the onset that var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had a different mindset , as they walloped their hosts by a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 26 margin in the first quarter . They maintained their advantage through the second period , leading to a 61 - 48 halftime edge . However , intermission must have served as a wake - up call for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , which roared out of the gates in the third quarter and doubled up their feisty visitors , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - 16 . Ultimately , however , it all came down to the best player on the court , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' point guard led all scorers with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points , and his 16 - foot basket with five seconds remaining snapped a 99 - 99 deadlock and provided the home team with the final margin of victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was paced by var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who went for var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][STL] rebounds , var_player[1][5][STL] assists and var_player[1][5][STL] steals in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed with matching var_player[1][4][PTS] - point efforts , with the former providing var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block , and the latter supplying var_player[1][4][FTA] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FG3A] steals . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] offered var_player[1][6][FGA] points , var_player[1][7][REB] boards and a steal , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][AST] assists , var_player[1][6][PF] rebounds and var_player[1][6][FG3A] steals in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes , his most extensive game action in some time . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , a steal and a block to his aforementioned scoring total . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] each went for var_player[0][1][PTS] points , and Otto_Porter , Jr. registered 11 points , var_player[0][3][FTM] rebounds , var_player[0][3][FTM] assists , var_player[0][3][PF] steals and a block . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included a steal and a block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[0][5][FGA] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][DREB] blocks .

Rookie var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] struggled to find his shot and went var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field to score var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] continued to start as the other guard and had var_player[1][3][PTS] points of his own , to go along with var_player[1][3][FG3M] assists in var_player[1][3][FG3_PCT] minutes . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to the win with var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( ankle ) out of the lineup once again . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] shot var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field to score var_player[0][3][PTS] points and added var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded his second double - double of the season , going for var_player[0][2][FGA] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in 40 minutes . Joakim_Noah sat out the game with an illness , pushing var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] into the starting lineup and forcing the team to lean more heavily on var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] . Filling in for var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] at the point , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] got the start but only scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes of action . Rookie var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] found his stroke off the bench , shooting var_player[0][6][FGM] - for - var_player[0][6][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][6][DREB] - for - var_player[0][6][FG3A] from three - point land .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's next game with be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came out and got off to a quick start in this one , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] right away in the first quarter . To go along with the quick start , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also shot the ball well , going 47 percent from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor . To put the icing on the cake , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished with a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 36 rebounding advantage , helping push them to a convincing 17 - point victory . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] backcourt of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] did the bulk of the damage for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in this var_player[1][3][OREB] . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][3][FG3A] from the three - point line to finish with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . After failing to reach double figures in points over his last four games , he finally got back into a rhythm and led the team in scoring Wednesday . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was just behind var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] , recording var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][AST] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][TO] FT ) , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FGM] assists . He 's put in two great performances in a row , combining for 36 points and 12 assists during that stretch . After coming off the bench Monday , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] moved back into the starting lineup . In 24 minutes , he posted 12 points ( 6 - 8 FG ) and four rebounds . Both var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] reached double - digit points off the bench , with var_player[1][5][PTS] and var_player[1][8][FGA] points respectively . Like the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , the majority of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] offense came from their backcourt . Point guard DJ var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTM] FT ) , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . He 's been very impressive lately , averaging 21 points and 8 assists over his last four games . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] also had a solid showing , posting var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - 14 FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTA] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds . Considering he 's averaging var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points on the season , it was a nice surprise for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who nearly recorded a double - double with var_player[0][2][FGA] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][BLK] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocked shots . It was his lowest scoring performance over his last six games , as he could n't get anything going against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . It was the third time in his last four games with two blocks though . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Thursday after the All-Star break , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday after the All-Star break as well .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) fell to the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in overtime Tuesday by a score of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . In an incredible , back - and - fourth game between the league 's best home team and third - best road team , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came out on top . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was unable to extend their home winning streak to 20 games as var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's last second floater was off the mark . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were uncharacteristically cold from beyond the arc , going 0 - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] from three in the second half and overtime . The adage `` live by the three , die by the three `` rang true Tuesday night for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] kicked off its pivotal six - game road trip with a feat that only one other team has accomplished this season , beating the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] at the Oracle Arena . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished the night with an interesting stat - line , with var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FGA] shots , var_player[1][4][PF] assist , and a career - high var_player[1][4][TO] turnovers . Stats never tell the whole story , however . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's last shot was a step - back three with var_player[1][4][REB] seconds remaining to give the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] the final lead . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will continue its road trip on Thursday against the Lakers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had n't lost at home since Nov. var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] , when it fell to San_Antonio 113 - 100 . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 51 points , but were just 6 - for - 19 from beyond the arc . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were missing var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] , who was a late scratch after coming down with flu - like symptoms . Despite Tuesday 's loss , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] still hold a four - and - a - half game lead in the West . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to rebound from its loss to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] on Friday in Utah .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . Despite playoff contention being a distant dream at this point of the season , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and their talented core of young superstars have n't come close to giving up . This could hardly have been more evident Friday , when var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] pulled out one of the season 's most improbable victories by toppling the struggling yet third - seeded var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in their home arena . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had appeared to put some of their recent sluggishness behind them by scoring consecutive victories over the Bucks and Clippers , after having lost six of the previous eight contests . However , they scuffled on offense throughout the night , shooting only 22 percent from three - point range and committing double the amount of turnovers ( 24 ) of the visitors . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] sealed the win for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][4][BLK] seconds left by draining a clutch var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - foot three - point jumper , after they 'd entered the fourth quarter trailing 73 - 66 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's near double - double that consisted of var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] boards , an assist , var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][1][STL] steals . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][FG3A] steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] followed with a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][2][TO] blocks and a steal . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] rounded things out for the first unit with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FG3M] steals . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] remains in last place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Monday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's two linchpins got virtually no offensive support from any of their teammates , a key factor in the unexpected loss . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , an assist and a block , but did commit var_player[0][0][DREB] turnovers . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was close behind with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FGM] assists and var_player[0][4][PF] rebounds , but turned the ball over var_player[0][4][TO] times himself . However , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other player to tally double - digit scoring , posting a var_player[0][5][PTS] - point , var_player[0][5][REB] - rebound double - double . Among the starters , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][1][BLK] of the most forgettable games of his career , going scoreless over var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes before fouling out . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] could only contribute var_player[0][3][PTS] points himself , and despite bringing in var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in a modest var_player[0][2][PTS] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] remains in first place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and retains a hold on the third seed in the conference . They head to San_Antonio for a Saturday night showdown with the Spurs .
MEMPHIS - var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] overcame his early postseason struggles to defeat the staunch var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defense Thursday and push the series to a deciding Game 7 that will be played Saturday on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's home court in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . While the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into the series as the favorites and seeded second in the Western Conference , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] appeared to hold the mental advantage most of the series , pushing the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to four consecutive overtime games in Games 2 - 5 , before being defeated handily Thursday . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] took a lot of heat from the press and fans after the series fell to var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] in favor of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] following Tuesday 's Game var_player[1][4][AST] loss , but the duo rebounded in Game var_player[1][4][FTA] , finishing with a combined 75 points . The pressure now shifts to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] for essentially the first time this series , with the team forced to try and steal another win on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's raucous home court , where var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , and company accumulated a record of 34 - var_player[1][4][DREB] during the regular season . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , starting center for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , said that the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are ready for the challenge . `` We already won two games on their court this series , so we know we can go in there and get a win , `` he said . `` They have great fans , but with all the veterans we have , rowdy fans do n't have as much of an impact as you might see with a team with a younger roster . `` The adversity the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have faced so far in their first - round series with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] has taken some of the shine off their championship lustre , but the dominant display they put on in Game var_player[1][4][FTM] highlights the level at which var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] can play when they are playing at their finest .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) by a score of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , on Saturday night in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] started strong and was up 59 - var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] going into half but var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came out of the dressing room with a boom , outscoring the 'Wolves 63 - 44 in the second half . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a huge game , responding to his recent limited minutes with a monstrous var_player[0][2][PTS] point , var_player[0][2][REB] rebound game . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] sank a late var_player[0][2][TO] to bring the game within var_player[0][2][FG3A] but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had the answer . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] from the field and finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][FTM] rebounds , in a heavy var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting but grabbed var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and dished a most impressive var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][7][PTS] points , on var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] shooting , and var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds , in var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had six players score in double digits and shot strong percentages going var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in scoring with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , along with var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds , in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[1][5][PTS] points on var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][PF] blocked shots , in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] played well , shooting var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field and finishing with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][REB] steals . C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] continued his strong play and showed he can do more than score with var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds to go along with his var_player[1][3][PTS] points . Next up var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will host the Clippers on Monday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will be in Milwaukee on Monday
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , coming off a hard - fought shootout with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday , announced earlier in the day that both var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] and J.R. Smith would both miss the game for rest . That propelled var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] into the starting var_player[1][4][FG3A] , and put an even bigger - than - usual spotlight on var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] . The latter duo did combine for 51 points , but conversely , the pair of spot starters could only muster nine points overall . That left a certain scoring vacuum that var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] simply could n't overcome , leading to only the second loss of the season for the defending champs . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and an assist . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was next with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and a steal . With such a large share of the offensive responsibility , both players combined to put up 43 shot attempts . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] could n't help on the scoreboard either , posting just var_player[1][2][FGA] points , but he did haul in var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , dished out var_player[1][2][AST] assists and recorded a block . Rookie var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with a pair of var_player[1][5][PTS] - point efforts , with the point total representing a career high for the former . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) saw four - fifths of their first unit manage double - digit scoring and were led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who supplied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][AST] assists , var_player[0][0][FTA] steals and a block . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , a steal and a block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FGM] boards , an assist and a steal , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks and a steal .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line compared to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] who shot only var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were also able to get to the line 10 more times than the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , which gave them just enough of an edge to get the one - point victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] spread the points around in a total team - effort victory . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] both recorded double - doubles .

With Rodney_Hood sitting out with plantar fasciitis in his foot , rookie var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] soaked up the majority of his playing time , as he had var_player[1][5][PTS] points and recorded var_player[1][5][AST] assits in 20 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got their biggest contribution from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . He finished the game shooting 8 - for - 15 from the field and 3 - for - 7 from beyond the arc for 23 points and five assists . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] struggled to begin the season with var_player[0][4][TO] var_player[0][4][FTA] - point games in a row , but he 's gotten into a groove lately and has now reached double figures in var_player[0][4][FTM] straight games . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a huge game on the boards as he finished with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was n't far behind with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds of his own , and the pair helped the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] out - rebound var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] to var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] also had var_player[0][1][PTS] points , as the team continues to play their big lineup with var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] coming of the bench . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures in scoring as he produced var_player[0][0][PTS] points , while also coming var_player[0][0][FTM] rebound shy of a double - double with var_player[0][0][REB] .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . This game looked lopsided in the first quarter and it did n't get much better after that . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] carried a var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - point lead into the fourth quarter and dominated throughout . The key for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was their defense , as they held var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to under var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting and forced them to commit var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . To put that in perspective , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] committed just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers and shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue to battle for playoff positioning and easy wins like this are a great momentum booster . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was majestic , as he tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds in the win . J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] also played well , as he amassed var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][DREB] assists . No other player scored more than 11 , but they got a nice rest with no one playing more than 30 minutes . Up next for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] is a matchup with the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Thursday . Losses like this are expected with a young team like var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and there are still things to take away . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , while also grabbing var_player[0][2][REB] boards . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] really struggled though , as he collected just var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][FG3M] assist , while committing var_player[0][0][TO] turnovers on var_player[0][0][PF] - for - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will play the Utah Jazz in their next game on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena . For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , they continue to roll as they have now won four in a row after dropping three straight . Wednesday night , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] served as the hero , as not only did he drop yet another triple - double with var_player[0][4][FGA] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , but he also hit a step - back var_player[0][4][PF] - pointer in the closing moments to send the game into overtime - - the only var_player[0][4][PF] he hit in the game . From there , he would not be denied a victory , as he went on to score 14 of the team 's var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points in the overtime period , outscoring the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , 14 - 10 , on his own . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's night was n't the most efficient , however , as he shot just var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][PTS] from the field and var_player[0][4][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from behind the arc . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , on the other hand , had a very efficient evening , shooting var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field en route to var_player[0][3][PTS] points on top of var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][DREB] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) are now losers of two of their last three games as they continue to battle inconsistent play early in this season . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , however , has remained consistently deadly since returning from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games . His 31 points on Wednesday night was his second straight 30 - point effort in a row and he is now averaging 29 points over his last three games . His partner in the backcourt var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] struggled shooting from the field , going just var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] overall and var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from behind the arc , but he did record var_player[1][4][AST] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists - - his second double - double in a row and fourth in the last five games . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look back on this game , however , and see many missed opportunities at the free throw line , where they made just 16 of their var_team[1][TEAM-AST] attempts . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to extend their winning streak on Sunday against the Pelicans , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head to San_Antonio on Friday to take on the Spurs .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) left no loose - ends as they defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) by a score of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , on Friday night in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] held the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to only var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and commanded control of the game with their defense . They led for the whole second half . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] players score but only three of those players scored in double digits . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_player[0][0][PTS] points and made it a double double with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] also added var_player[0][7][PTS] points off the bench . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was missing Kenneth_Faried who sat out with an ankle sprain . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] managed to take care of business even with out two of their veteran leaders , Manu_Ginobili and Tim_Duncan . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] did what he is trained to do and stepped up for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the absence of his veteran mates , finishing with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][DREB] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points and dished var_player[1][4][AST] assists in 24 minutes .

var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] 's performance in Wednesday 's victory over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was more than just a completely surprise , it was completely out of character . With his var_player[0][6][PTS] - point , var_player[0][6][REB] - rebound performance , var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] scored the second highest point total of his career , with var_player[0][6][REB] being the highest , and recorded a career - high var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds in just var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . In the season and a half he 's played in the NBA , var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] had recorded just var_player[0][6][PF] career double - doubles before Wednesday night , and they both came against the Trail_Blazers within three days of each other . This season alone , var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] only had var_player[0][6][FTM] games where he recorded double - digit rebounds and Wednesday was his first double - digit scoring outing of the 2016 - var_player[0][6][REB] season . With var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] steal dealing with a lingering hamstring injury , var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] 's performance against var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] may have given the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] some much - needed insurance in their frontcourt rotation .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] made a run in the fourth though , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] , but the comeback fell short as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] finished with an eight - point victory . While the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were out - rebounded var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] , they shot better than the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the leader for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in this game , posting a game - high of var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][STL] - var_player[0][3][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][PF] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][3][PF] assists and var_player[0][3][PF] steals . He had a poor shooting performance ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt ) in Sunday 's game against the Clippers , so it was good to see him find his shot and have some success . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also had a nice contribution from their bench , as var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][7][PTS] points ( var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][7][FTM] - var_player[0][7][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][7][FG3M] assists in only var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes . He 's been playing his best basketball of the season offensively , averaging 23 points over his last five games . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] also had an efficient night from the bench with var_player[0][9][PTS] points ( var_player[0][9][FGM] - var_player[0][9][FGA] FG , var_player[0][9][OREB] - var_player[0][9][BLK] FT ) and var_player[0][9][REB] rebounds in only var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes .

It 's a very rare occurence for var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] to lead this team in scoring , so it was clear var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] did n't have their best games offensively . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][REB] - var_player[1][3][FG3M] 3Pt ) , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][REB] assists , while var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][4][FG3M] rebound . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] had just put in var_player[1][4][FG3A] solid games in a row , so it was a surprise to see his shot not falling . Getting the start at power forward , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FGM] FT ) and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . It was his second double - double in his last three games . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was the high scorer off the bench with var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][FG3M] - var_player[1][7][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][7][PF] - var_player[1][7][FTA] FT ) in 23 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday .

In fact , this is the third straight game in which that has happened . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] tallied just var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in the loss and he has yet to reach double - digits in scoring , assisting or rebounding this season . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] put up a rare line in this game , scoring var_player[1][0][PTS] points and failing to record anything else but var_player[1][0][BLK] rebound and var_player[1][0][REB] block . There was a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - point swing in this game , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] led by var_team[1][TEAM-AST] in the first half , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took a 10 - point in the second half . These two teams will have a rematch in Minneapolis on Dec. 23 for their next meeting .

As a whole , the Dubs shot over 48 percent from the field and recorded a stellar 28 team assists . OKC ( 40 - 30 ) came into the game relatively hot but were stopped cold by the powerhouse var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . It was an off night for superstar point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , though for a monster like var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , that term is obviously relative . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] still managed to fill the stat sheet with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds , and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . However , he shot a dismal 4 - of - 16 from the field and turned the ball over five times . As a team , it was a remarkably poor offensive night for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . They made just over 42 percent of their shots and could not hit the deep ball , going just 4 - of - 21 from beyond the arc . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit Dallas on Tuesday , while OKC will host the 76ers on Wednesday .
The point guards for both the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] rounded out the box score to astronomical numbers across the four periods and overtime . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] headlined the game , once again , adding another triple - double to his already impressive 2016 - 2017 campaign . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was lackluster on the defensive end of the floor , but made up for it with a tremendous effort down the stretch and especially from the free throw line . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[1][4][FGM] assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds on var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting , including a perfect var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][4][FTA] from the charity stripe . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's needed the overtime to complete the triple - double , but was also the reason that var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to reach the extended period after burying a three pointer from 27 - feet with only a few seconds left in the fourth quarter .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] demolished the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Friday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) is on the verge of its third straight 60 - win season , holding the league 's top record with just 10 games remaining .

Reigning MVP Steph var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was the team leader in scoring , pouring in var_player[0][4][PTS] points , and also contributed var_player[0][4][STL] steals on the defensive end . All-Defense forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , had var_player[0][1][FG3M] steals and a block while scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] points . The var_player[0][3][PF] more than made up for a cold night from sharpshooter var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who went just var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field . The night was just one of many great ones for the historic var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] offense , as the team shot almost 50 percent from the field while dishing out a ridiculous var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) is far from the top , as the team dropped its fourth straight game on Friday in miserable fashion . The team showed promise , however , as recently - acquired rookie var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had arguably his best game as a pro . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] scored a team - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FGM] assists . It was also a big night for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' other rookie sensation , var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] . Just a week after becoming the first member of the 2016 draft class to score 30 points , var_player[1][9][SECOND_NAME] narrowly missed his first career triple - double , coming away with var_player[1][9][REB] points , var_player[1][9][PTS] rebounds , and var_player[1][9][AST] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will host the Grizzlies on Sunday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit the LA Clippers .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went without a field goal for a 6:58 stretch in the period as their offense just could n't get revved up . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] never trailed in the game 's final period as they coasted to the victory . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][0][PTS] points and hit var_player[1][0][FG3M] three - pointers to lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were launching three - pointers all game , and managed to hit 13 of 37 attempts ( 35 percent ) . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished with a game - high var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG ) and added var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and a pair of assists . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points ) and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][AST] assists , four rebounds , var_player[0][0][STL] steals , var_player[0][3][FG3A] blocks ) were the only other var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to even reach double - figures . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] actually shot a solid var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - 65 ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent ) from the floor , but they managed just two offensive rebounds and hit only three three - point shots , and even their relatively efficient performance inside was n't enough to keep up with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's three - point barrage .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been up and down all year , as is evident from their var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] record .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] in overtime on Friday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this game as a heavy underdog , but got a game - winning tip from var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] to steal a win . The key for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was the three - point shooting , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] went var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - for - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] going just 6 - for - 26 . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] did dominate down low though , as they scored a season - high 70 points in the paint , while outrebounding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] to var_team[1][TEAM-REB] .

The benches for both the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were instrumental in keeping both teams in the game , but no var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] player finished with any astronomical numbers , save for J.J.Barea . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] chimed in with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][AST] assists and var_player[1][5][FG3M] rebounds , and included a strong var_player[1][5][FG3_PCT] percent shooting from behind the arc . The rest of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench attack was led by var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] , who combined for 15 points and five boards . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] spread their bench out with most of the rotation seeing around 15 minutes of play . var_player[0][6][FIRST_NAME] Hilario added var_player[0][6][PTS] points to counteract var_player[0][2][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][2][PTS] points but was less effective on the boards . Second-year Wisconsin product var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[0][8][FGM] - of - var_player[0][8][FGM] from deep and added var_player[0][8][PTS] points in minutes of action in the winning effort .
var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] erased a 32 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] first - quarter deficit by outscoring their hosts by an 87 - 71 margin over the final var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] periods . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][0][PTS] - point , var_player[1][0][REB] - rebound double - double led the way and the bench combined for 56 points . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][3][PTS] points and had a clutch block of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ' three - point attempt with 12 seconds left . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] combined for a modest var_player[1][2][MIN] points , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] went scoreless over var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . However , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] supplied respective tallies of var_player[1][5][PTS] , var_player[1][7][PTS] and var_player[1][6][PTS] points from the bench . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] ' var_player[0][4][PTS] points led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , while var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[0][3][PTS] points . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 30 points , with the latter also hauling in var_player[0][0][FGA] boards . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with a pair of var_player[0][6][FGA] - point efforts .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday , The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have been playing some dominant basketball this season , but this was a dud against a desperate var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] stifled them with their defense , holding them to 70 points on 31 percent from the field and 17 percent from three - point range . The assist - to - turnover ratio was a huge factor as well , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] recording var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists to just var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] turnovers and var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] committing var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] turnovers to just var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists . Those numbers allowed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to take 22 more shots than the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , making nearly twice as many shots . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has been one of the best teams early on in the season , but they really struggled here . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , tallying var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] also struggled with his shot , totaling var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][DREB] assists on var_player[1][4][DREB] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at Philips Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . After suffering a tough 104 - 98 defeat to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in game number var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] started this outing with some added fire and out - scored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] right away in the first quarter . Throughout the rest of the game , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] slowly made their way back though , closing the gap to just five points with around four minutes left in the game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] made var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] final push and responded with a strong offensive run of their own , eventually finishing with an impressive 16 - point victory in front of their home crowd . With the victory , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] tied the series at var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] win apiece and they 'll have the momentum going into game three in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , but with John_Wall sitting out due to a wrist injury , they were missing their most important weapon . While it was n't surprising the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] could n't overcome the loss of Wall , his replacement , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , still had a solid showing as a starter . He went 8 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a playoff career - high of 21 points , while also adding four assists . While he played well , he still did n't have the playmaking ability that Wall is known for , so it was n't enough to propel the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to a win . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was another reason the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to come back after a weak first quarter . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][PF] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][OREB] - var_player[1][3][STL] FT ) , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists over var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] has now combined for 48 points , var_player[1][3][FGM] assists and four steals over the first var_player[1][3][PF] games of this series , so he 's been very effective and should continue as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . Both var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures in points as well . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][DREB] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][REB] - var_player[1][6][REB] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][0][FG3M] rebounds , while var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FTA] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][AST] - var_player[1][6][PF] FT ) , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FGM] assists off the bench . If var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] can continue to play this well off the bench , he 'll only make this var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' team even more dangerous once Wall returns . The winner of this game of course was the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] though , as their frontcourt was dominant . The trio of var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] all helped the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' starting frontcourt to out - score the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt 58 - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] led the team , finishing with var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][AST] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][FG3A] assists . He continues to be a surprise for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] considering how consistent he 's been throughout the playoffs . He 's now posted six straight games with 20 or more points and is averaging 19 points over eight outings this postseason . He only averaged 13 points during the regular season , so he 's really elevated his play . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] contributed with var_player[0][2][PTS] points a piece . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][STL] steals , while var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][1][FGM] assists and var_player[0][2][STL] steals . While not something they 're usually known for , the combined steals from both var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] helped force the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] into var_player[0][1][FGA] turnovers , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] committed just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] of their own . Coming off the bench , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] went a perfect var_player[0][6][FGA] - for - var_player[0][6][FGM] from the field and var_player[0][6][FG3A] - for - var_player[0][6][TO] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][6][PTS] points over var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . These two teams will play next on Saturday in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for game number three of this best - of - seven series .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) beat the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] won their sixth straight game , comfortably settling into the second slot in the Western Conference . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] each returned from a var_player[0][4][FG3M] - game hiatus .

They outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , 44 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] , in the paint . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] host the Orlando Magic on Monday , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] begin a three - game road trip Monday against the Phoenix Suns .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] continued their dominance at home , as they extended their home winning streak to start the season to 18 games , but this one did n't come easy , as the young and improving var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] put up a fight for var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] minutes . It was n't var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's most impressive outing , but it was once again their balanced play that led them to victory , as var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] players scored in double figures . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] continues to play like an All-Star , as he led the way with a double - double of var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . Boba var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] matched var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][7][PTS] , recording as many in just var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes off the bench while shooting var_player[0][7][FGM] - for - var_player[0][7][FGM] from the field . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][5][PTS] ) , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][PTS] ) , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] ) and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][6][PTS] ) round out the var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] who scored in double figures . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the way scoring for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in the losing effort , posting var_player[1][3][FGA] points and var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes , while rookie star var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double of var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) rode their var_player[1][0][PF] biggest stars to victory , as var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 65 points on a 19 - for - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] tally from the field . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] has - - for the moment , at least - - taken the title of team MVP from var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , as he 's averaged 31 points over his first var_player[1][4][AST] contests in a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] uniform while playing between var_player[1][0][PTS] and 39 minutes in each . Although var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] struggled considerably from three - point range as a team - - managing only a var_player[1][4][PTS] percent success rate - - var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was lights out from beyond the arc , draining var_player[1][4][FTA] of his var_player[1][4][FG3A] long - distance attempts . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][0][PTS] points led all scorers , a figure that he supplemented with var_player[1][0][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists , var_player[1][0][FG3A] steals and a block .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][4][OREB] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] ) had a curious stat sheet overall , var_player[0][0][BLK] that was decidedly tipped towards T.J. var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] continues to thrive as a starter , tallying a team - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points , along with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block . The third - year pro has averaged 28 points over his last two games on 23 - of - 41 shooting . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FTM] assists , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] provided a modest var_player[0][2][PTS] points , but in typical fashion brought down var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , and he also dished out an assist . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's night was notable for his struggles from the field , as he was only able to muster var_player[0][3][PTS] points while finding the net on var_player[0][3][FGM] of var_player[0][3][FGA] shot attempts overall . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , the third member of the talented backcourt rotation , did n't fare much better with an identical shooting tally , but did pace the reserves with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , while adding var_player[0][5][PF] assists , a rebound and a pair of steals . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head to Portland for a potential shootout with the Blazers on Tuesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are in Los_Angeles on Monday night to face the Clippers .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) came away with their first victory of the season in Tuesday 's trip to the Palace of Auburn Hills , knocking off the previously undefeated var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] rode the strength of a 220 run in the second quarter to the win , which came after starting center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] departed the game with a back injury . The frontcourt reserve trio of var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] covered well for var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's absence , combining for 20 points , 16 rebounds , and var_player[1][5][REB] blocks over 60 minutes . They were n't the only contributors off the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bench , which outscored its var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] counterparts by a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] - 2 margin . Backup guard var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the charge with var_player[1][6][PTS] points against his former team . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][1][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][1][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FGM] assists , and var_player[1][1][OREB] steals . On the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] side , taking care of the ball proved to be a major issue . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished with var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] turnovers against just var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists , with point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][AST] turnovers ) the most egregious offender . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] also turned the ball over on var_player[0][2][TO] occasions , but more than made up for it with a super - size double - double of var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - for - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting ) and a career - high var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . He 's now averaging a Chamberlain-esque var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] boards over the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' four games . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will head back home for a matchup with the Boston Celtics on Wednesday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] gets a two - day break before heading out to Phoenix for a game Friday against the Suns .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] continues to sputter along . Despite being a veteran - laden team , they 've only played so - so to this point . They dropped five straight games coming into Friday and barely got past the injury - depleted var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue their three - game road trip in San_Antonio on Saturday against the Spurs . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has lost five straight games . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] moved back into the starting lineup at shooting guard , pushing var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] back to a bench role . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] put up var_player[0][3][PTS] points in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes , but his production comes mostly on the defensive end . var_player[0][9][SECOND_NAME] played just var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will stay home and host the Golden_State Warriors on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) won for the fifth time in six games Saturday with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] victory against the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , last season 's Western Conference eighth seed , has been slowly climbing out of the bottom of the standings since the start of the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] Year . The win over var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] puts the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] just three games behind the Sacramento Kings in the conference playoff race . Per usual , the Pels owed a large portion of their success on Saturday to the play of superstar var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] . The fourth - year power forward failed to repeat his starting All-Star honors this season , but has quietly been averaging a double - double with 23 points per game . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's game was nothing short of the ordinary on Saturday , as he posted var_player[0][1][PTS] points while pulling down var_player[0][1][FTA] rebounds , dishing out var_player[0][1][AST] assists , and blocking var_player[0][1][BLK] shots . It was forward var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , however , who led the team in scoring with var_player[0][6][PTS] points while coming off the bench . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] converted an impressive var_player[0][6][REB] of var_player[0][6][FG3A] shots from beyond the three - point line . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are now facing a two - game slide after finally seeing a three - game stretch of good luck . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] currently sits at last in the central division and thirteenth in the Eastern Conference , just one year after a surprising appearance in the playoffs . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] held advantages in rebounding , field - goal shooting , and free - throw shooting over the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , but were still blown out in large part due to an var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] disadvantage in the turnover department . Perimeter defense also posed a problem for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] went an impressive 17 for 31 from beyond the arc . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will have two days of rest before hosting the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , will continue their homestand on Monday as they face the Houston Rockets at Smoothie King Center .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( foot ) returned to the starting lineup after missing the last var_player[0][4][FTA] games . The hometown var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] crowd was ecstatic to have their all star point guard back , but it looks like var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] will need another game or var_player[0][4][FG3M] to shake the cobwebs off . He finished with 17 points on 4 - of - 14 shooting in 35 minutes . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] returned to his bench role and added var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds , while C.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] rounded out the backcourt with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][PF] assists and var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds . Turnovers were an issue for the guard rotation throughout the effort , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] slow , physical game plan took advantage of the var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] mistakes var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] committed . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was responsible for var_player[0][4][FTM] of the turnovers , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are aware of the hindering foot injury and it should not be long before he returns to his elite level of play . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] converted a double - double to lead the frontcourt , adding var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's career high var_player[0][0][DREB] points per game and 7 rebounds per game are proving to be a strong signing for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Los_Angeles Clippers ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - 13 ) on Wednesday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is coming off a tough overtime loss to the Utah Jazz on Saturday , where point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( back ) played 41 minutes on a sore back . The day off was spent traveling , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] staple is their tough , physical style of play . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] never came within striking distance and that came on the shoulders of var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who added var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][FGA] rebounds in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] started at the forward positions , but struggled to aid the scoring sheet after combining to go var_player[1][0][FTM] - for - 17 from the field . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FTM] rebounds , while not allowing a turnover , in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] managed the clock well , took care of the basketball and won the rebounding battle ( var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 42 ) to spoil Lillards return and come away with a road win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] tough road trip continues when they face the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 24 - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , Wednesday at AT & T Center . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) elected to rest stars Kawhi_Leonard and LaMarcus_Aldridge for the night , and their impact , or lack thereof , could be felt in the first quarter , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] fell behind by 22 points after the first var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] minutes of the game and ultimately went into halftime facing a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point deficit . However , the second half was a much different story , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ended up winning the second 24 minutes by an astonishing var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] points to bury the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . Without the var_player[0][9][FTA] stars , var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] managed to turn back the clock and lead the way scoring for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , recording var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][AST] assists , var_player[0][9][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][9][FG3M] steals in var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] shined off the bench as well , recording var_player[0][8][PTS] points and var_player[0][8][AST] assists in var_player[0][8][MIN] minutes as a reserve . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also took advantage of the extended playing time , recording a double - double of var_player[0][1][PTS] points on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes as a member of the starting lineup . As for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] shined in his first start since being traded , scoring a game - high var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] shooting from the field . There were n't many other highlights from what turned out to be a disappointing performance from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , but rookie big man var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] continues to show his potential , as he recorded an efficient var_player[1][9][PTS] points on var_player[1][9][FGM] - of - var_player[1][9][FGA] shooting from the field in var_player[1][9][MIN] minutes off the bench Wednesday . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to extend their winning streak to 10 games in Oklahoma_City on Thursday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce back and end their six - game losing streak Friday against the Wizards .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came into the contest tied with the Heat as the stingiest Eastern Conference team in terms of points allowed , yielding only 95 per game . They further cemented their reputation with a suffocation of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's offense , preventing their starting five from producing a single double - digit scorer . The Cavs made life miserable for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shooting - wise , as the visitors could only muster a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field , and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent figure from beyond the arc . On the offensive end , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also took excellent care of the ball , committing only six turnovers in contrast to the var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] they forced from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was actually led by var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][6][PTS] points off the bench , which he complemented with var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and a pair of assists . A pair of var_player[1][9][PTS] - point tallies from var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] , who were also in reserve roles , served as the next highest totals . The former added four rebounds , an assist and a steal , while the latter contributed six boards and three assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points paced the starting var_player[1][4][FGA] , a group that bottomed out with a scoreless effort from var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes .

The frontcourt tandem of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] put together a pair of var_player[0][2][PTS] - point double - doubles that were supplemented with var_player[0][2][REB] and var_player[0][1][REB] boards , respectively . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to pace the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] reserves with var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][FTA] rebounds and an assist .

David_Lee ( hamstring ) is nearing a return but has yet to be cleared to return to action , and even when Lee does return , there does n't seem to be more than a marginal role off off the bench available to him . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with a game - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points Saturday , and he was helped by var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who both also finished with var_player[1][1][PTS] - plus points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is playing a back - to - back set .

As a result they 're just 2 - 3 over their last five games . Chandler_Parsons suffered a back injury Tuesday but then played through the injury Wednesday .

The shooting was just as lopsided for the whole game , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shooting var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] hitting just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their shots .

They had dropped var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] straight games before pulling out the win over the injury - depleted var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Since being challenged by coach Stan Van Gundy to start being more aggressive on offense , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has responded by looking for his shot earlier in games . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finish their four - game road trip in Memphis on Saturday against the Grizzlies . Despite playing without their two MVP-level players in var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( hand ) and Kevin_Durant ( foot ) , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have competed realitively well . They 're var_player[0][4][FTA] - var_player[0][4][FTA] in their last var_player[0][4][DREB] games , and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continues to put up All-Star numbers to try and show that he is indeed an All-Star caliber player when given the minutes and possessions to prove it . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] bounced back from two poor games to score a team - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points .

On top of that , var_player[0][12][FIRST_NAME] scored a team - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points and dished out var_player[0][4][AST] assists . It was another solid outing for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] as well , as the forward scored var_player[0][1][PTS] points while grabbing var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and recording var_player[0][1][REB] assists . On the opposing side , var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' guard var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] stepped into a leading role for the shorthanded var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' offense . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continued to gain some steam as the regular season winds down , notching their third straight victory and finishing the season sweep over the Sixers . They 've already locked up the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings , so this was another solid momentum builder for the playoffs that start this coming Saturday . The game did get somewhat chippy towards the end though , as both var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] and O.J . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] received technical fouls for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , while Jakaar var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] picked var_player[1][5][OREB] up for the Sixers . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers finished at var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had another strong showing , finishing with var_player[1][4][MIN] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][DREB] assists and var_player[1][4][PF] steals . Over his last four games , he 's averaged var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points , six assists and 3 steals , so the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] would love to see him stay this hot going into their playoff series with either the Toronto Raptors or Chicago Bulls . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had a solid overall game as well , recording var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists over var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . He 'll take season averages of 13 points and 7 rebounds into the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' final matchup on Wednesday .

The Sixers were led by the duo of var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][0][FGM] - for - var_player[0][0][FTA] from the field , but just var_player[0][0][OREB] - for - var_player[0][0][FGM] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[0][0][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][BLK] blocked shots . It was n't all good for the forward though , as he turned the ball over a whopping 10 times . He 's played well over these final games other than the turnovers , averaging 24 points over his last three . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , finished with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][TO] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds over var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] shot less than 40 percent from the field in var_player[0][3][FG3M] of his last var_player[0][3][REB] games coming into this var_player[0][3][DREB] , so it was a step in the right direction Monday with his performance . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and Jakaar var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] finished in double figures off the bench . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][8][FGA] FG , var_player[0][8][FTM] - var_player[0][5][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][8][PTS] points ( var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][8][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][8][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][8][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite only leading var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] - 75 going into the fourth quarter , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to out - score the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] in the final quarter to give themselves a comfortable var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - point victory at home . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to shoot extremely well in this one , as they went var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and a ridiculous var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] on the other hand finished at only var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . In a surprise performance off the bench , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] was a big contributor to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] superior shooting percentages . He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 20 points in 23 minutes . He also had a season - high of 10 rebounds , giving him his first double - double of the year . He 's averaging just over 14 minutes per game on the season , so he was able to cash in on the extra playing time he received . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also had one of his better games of the season . He went a perfect 8 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from beyond the arc to score 18 points in only 27 minutes . He had 23 points against the Spurs on Friday and 15 against a tough Rockets team Wednesday , so he 's had a nice stretch of games during the last week . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3A] - var_player[0][1][OREB] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][DREB] - var_player[0][3][REB] FT ) also reached double figures in points with var_player[0][3][PTS] apiece . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was var_player[0][2][FGM] of the lone players to struggle offensively , as he had only var_player[0][2][TO] points in 27 minutes , but he still had var_player[0][2][FGA] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists , so it was n't all bad for var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong game for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . He went 11 - for - 20 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the free throw line to score 25 points , while also adding six assists . He 's caught fire in the last three games , scoring 28 , 28 and now 25 over that stretch . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] is now averaging 22 points and var_player[1][3][AST] assists on the season . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] did n't have as big of a game as he 's come accustomed to . He scored 12 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 0 - 2 FT ) and recorded only two rebounds in 35 minutes . It was his first time in nine games not reaching at least 15 points , and only the second time all season grabbing less than five rebounds , so do n't expect him to have this sort of game again any time soon . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] had var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] out of the 19 points from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's bench , while also notching his second game in row with at least var_player[1][5][STL] steals . The rest of the bench really struggled , which may have been the deciding factor in this one . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Tuesday .
Despite seeing only one player score over var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to come away with the win over the elite var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Tuesday . Big man var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while var_player[1][1][FG3A] other var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] players scored in double - digits . The team also recorded 12 steals in total , with five different players recording multiple steals on the night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hit only six three - pointers , but were able to hold the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to five threes on var_team[1][TEAM-AST] percent shooting . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , star forward var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][0][PTS] points to lead the team . Forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also had a solid var_player[0][1][PTS] points . The rest of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starting five , however , combined for just 10 points . Additionally , the team recorded 18 turnovers , leading to numerous extra possessions for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in overtime on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] stopped their two - game losing streak with the win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] sat out their loss to the Phoenix Suns on Friday with flu symptoms , but he was able to return Saturday and led the team with a game - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points to go with var_player[0][2][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] got in on the fun as well . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][FG3_PCT] points , while var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] posted a double - double of var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] could n't be stopped on offense , shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc and var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent from the foul line . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will try to keep the good times rolling when they embark on a four - game road trip that begins against the Brooklyn Nets on Monday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost seven straight games , and the immediate future looks bleak for them . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] continues to play through knee soreness , putting up var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes , playing like a man in his prime . var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] sat out , resting for the third time in their last four games . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] were the soup du jour in the frontcourt for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Both performed adequately . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has two more games on their Western Conference road trip . They 'll take on the Portland Trail_Blazers on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] on Friday . Both teams entered the game with their rosters at less than full strength , and the result was a gritty , grind - it - out affair . The visitors were missing stalwart power forward Kenneth_Faried , who was out due to the birth of his child , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had their starting backcourt sidelined . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] was forced to miss a second consecutive contest with a left Achilles injury , while a hip contusion derailed two - guard var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] for the night . While the three players ' respective replacements all turned in serviceable efforts , it was some of the team 's most reliable performers that led the way . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's attack was spearheaded by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who managed his second var_player[1][0][PTS] - point outing over the last var_player[1][0][AST] contests , and who scored over 20 points for the fourth straight game since returning from a var_player[1][0][FG3A] - game absence due to an ankle injury . Faried 's replacement on the night , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , was actually the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' second leading scorer , managing var_player[1][1][FGA] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , a pair of assists and a pair of blocks . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other starter with double - digit scoring , pouring in var_player[1][3][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , an assist and a steal . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] took another positive step in his gradual return to action , collecting var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][PTS] rebounds and a block over var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head back home and await the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday . Although var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] saw all five members of their starting unit tally double - digit points , they were actually led in scoring by var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who pitched in var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , an assist and var_player[0][5][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's near double - double headed up the starters , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' forward contributing var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][OREB] assists and a steal . Frontcourt mate var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was right behind him with a stat - sheet - stuffing performance that consisted of var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FGA] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FG3M] assists and a block . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][10][SECOND_NAME] 's stand - in for the night , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , posted a pair of var_player[0][2][PTS] - point efforts . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] had a relatively quiet night on the boards with only var_player[0][2][PF] rebounds , but dished out a trio of assists and also snatched var_player[0][2][STL] steals . Meanwhile , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] had a slow first half , but came on after intermission to finish with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[0][4][FTM] assists . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did a fine job as var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] 's replacement , finishing with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , an assist , var_player[0][3][FTA] steals and a block . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They now await the Boston Celtics for Sunday showdown .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] secured their first victory under interim head coach Tony var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] - - and broke a 10 - game home losing streak - - with some uncharacteristic offense that included a late 10 - 2 run . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had astoundingly failed to reach 90 points in four straight games coming into Wednesday , and had not even managed to hit the 80 - point mark in three of those contests . Meanwhile , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came in sporting a Top 10 - ranked defensive unit in terms of points allowed , but did learn shortly before game time that superstar var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] would sit out with the ankle sprain that had caused him to leave Tuesday 's showdown with the Celtics early . Despite an outstanding performance from var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench that helped make up for a large part of the points var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] took with him to the bench , it was a resurgent var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] squad that got key contributions from a combination of starters and reserves that helped key the win . var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] did lead the visitors with a season - high var_player[1][7][PTS] - point performance , his best outing since he amassed the same total versus the Mavericks back on December var_player[1][7][FTM] , 2013 while a member of the Sacramento Kings .

Veteran var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] stuffed the stat sheet with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][AST] assists and a steal . var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] also decided to give the starting backcourt of var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] an opportunity at redemption after a lackluster first game together , and they responded with slightly better production . The former managed 10 points , a pair of rebounds and a pair of assists , while the latter provided eight points , four rebounds , three assists and a steal .

However , that was n't enough for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to prevent their losing streak from extending to var_player[1][4][AST] games , despite the fact that var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] also poured in var_player[1][4][PTS] points .

Both players eclipsed 30 minutes of action , but played a rather slow paced game on their way to 24 combined points .

Those two led the way for a now - revamped bench unit that carried var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] all game long , as seven bench players combined to score var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] points and made up for an underwhelming performance from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who had just var_player[1][3][PTS] points in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes . As for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , the daunting frontcourt of var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] did their job , but the rest of the team struggled . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] led the way with a team - high var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] posted his first double - double as a Pelican , recording var_player[0][2][PTS] points , 14 rebounds , fives assists , var_player[0][2][FG3A] steals and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes .

Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head home Saturday to take on the Timberwolves , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to turn things around Saturday in Dallas .

The Mavs fell behind by a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] score after one quarter and never could catch up against a suffocating var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defense that limited them to 38 percent shooting overall and a 25 percent mark from behind the arc . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] co - led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with matching var_player[1][3][PTS] - point efforts , with the former providing var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][3][PF] rebounds , a steal and a block , and the latter supplying var_player[1][1][FGM] boards and var_player[1][3][STL] assist . P.J . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] drew the start and produced a near double - double with var_player[1][0][REB] points , var_player[1][0][PTS] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's scoring total and added var_player[1][0][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][2][FTA] assist and var_player[1][2][STL] steal . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] generated a full stat line of var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds and an assist . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] paced var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][0][STL] steals . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[0][4][PTS] points and added var_player[0][4][FG3M] assists , a rebound and a steal . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][BLK] steals and var_player[0][3][FTA] blocks ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PF] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , a block ) provided modest but solid performances . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][10][FGA] points , var_player[0][10][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][10][DREB] assists and var_player[0][10][PF] steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the Orlando Magic on Monday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to tangle with the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Monday night as well .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Staples Center on Wednesday . A tale of two halves between a pair of the Western Conference 's best teams , and one that pointed towards a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] rout from the get go . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] stormed out to a twenty point lead behind var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , which has been the theme of their season so far . The scoring outbursts from the var_player[0][5][DREB] all - stars eventually went cold when it mattered most , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] rallied behind var_player[0][5][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] 's three point shooting and superb defense and var_player[0][2][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's smooth touch at the rim . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and company needed a miracle to make the comeback , and that miracle was granted after var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] made var_player[0][4][TO] free throws , as part of var_player[0][2][AST] possessions that sent him to the free throw line the old fashioned way . With just under 5:0 remaining in the fourth quarter , var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] drained back - to - back treys to pull within eight points of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Add in a trio of layups from var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][1][FIRST_NAME] ( in that order ) , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] found themselves down just var_player[0][6][REB] points . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] broke the cold streak with 2:0 remaining , but the aforementioned var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and - var_player[0][2][STL] 's came on the following possessions and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't look back , capping off the 22 point comeback and resilient victory . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][TO] blocks , while var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , who 's shot selection late in the game became strange , finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FTM] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in a double - double with var_player[1][1][REB] points and var_player[1][1][PTS] boards , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench was led by var_player[1][8][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][8][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][8][PTS] points and var_player[1][8][PTS] rebounds . On the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] end , it was var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's unselfish leadership , as he finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] deserves a lot of credit down the stretch , as he pestered var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] with fabulous defense , and scored var_player[1][0][REB] points off the bench . The volume shot selection was not the best of choice , seeing as he took 16 shots , but the ones that fell came at the right time to bail out the 4 - of - 16 shooting . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] nailed his free throws when they mattered most and totaled var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head north to cap off a brutal back - to - back against the Golden_State Warriors ( 54 - 5 ) on Thursday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will enjoy a few days off before hosting the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) on Saturday .
The dynamic duo of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to their 11th win in var_player[0][3][FGA] home games , with the former scoring a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points and the latter providing var_player[0][3][PTS] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] complemented his scoring total with var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and a steal and var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] filled out the stat sheet with var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][FTA] steals and a block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][5][DREB] , and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[0][5][FGA] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] limited the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting and induced var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] turnovers . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][6][PTS] and var_player[1][9][PTS] points , respectively , off the bench . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] could only muster var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] went for var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday . This was a lopsided matchup on paper and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] left no doubt with this dominating result . In fact , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] held a double - digit lead for the entirety of the second half , while leading by at least 20 points for the whole fourth quarter . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ended up shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , while holding Philly to just 43 percent . The rebounding differential was glaring , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] winning that battle , var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] . The 76 points in the paint was also huge for OKC , as that marked a season - high . The Sixers ( 26 - 45 ) continue to play shorthanded and results like this are inevitable with their best player sidelined . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was a bright spot for Philly , as he led the team with var_player[1][6][PTS] points off the bench . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the best starter , as he accumulated var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][REB] assists and var_player[1][1][FTA] blocks . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][0][PTS] points , adding var_player[1][1][FTM] rebounds and a block to his tally . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team , totaling var_player[1][9][PTS] points and var_player[1][9][REB] rebounds off the bench . On deck for the Sixers is a road matchup against the Chicago Bulls on Friday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) now have var_team[0][TEAM-AST] wins at home , as they 've made Chesapeake Energy Arena an absolute fortress . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] set another record , as he became the first ever player to record a triple - double , while not missing a shot . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished the game with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FTA] from the field . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , as he provided var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds off the bench . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] accrued var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and an assist . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will be off until Sunday , when they face the Houston Rockets on the road .
var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] has had a great start to the 2016 - 17 season and has looked like his old self , averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds per game thus far . His start to January , however , has been anything but great . Tuesday night against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] posted just var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes while shooting a sorry var_player[1][1][PF] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][1][TO] - of - var_player[1][1][FG3A] from behind the arc . When comparing it to the first two months of the season , it would be completely out of character , but when compared to his other games this January , it looks much more normal . In the var_player[1][1][AST] games he 's played this month , var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] has shot over var_player[1][1][FG3_PCT] percent from the field just once and is shooting a woeful 27 percent from behind the arc to start the new year . So , while his numbers look solid - - he 's averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds through those var_player[1][1][FGM] games - - var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] is playing at an alarmingly inefficient rate .
var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted over half of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' scoring with a combined 23 - of - 34 tally from the floor . They spearheaded a red - hot offense that managed 57 percent shooting , including 60 percent from three - point range . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] notably outscored their hosts by a 67 - 45 margin after intermission . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] registered a game - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points , along with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][BLK] assists , var_player[1][0][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while rookie var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] supplied his first career triple - double with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and 11 rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with a var_player[1][5][PTS] - point , var_player[1][5][REB] - rebound double - double . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][0][PTS] points led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] provided a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][FTM] - rebound double - double , and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[0][1][PTS] points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] only mustered var_player[0][3][FG3A] and var_player[0][3][PTS] points , respectively , and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][5][PTS] point - effort led the reserves .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) lost for the15th time in their last 16 games Thursday , falling var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] to the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's backcourt of var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 52 points in the contest , dropping in var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] and var_player[0][4][PTS] respectively . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] also contributed var_player[0][3][AST] assists in what was a resounding victory for the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] squad . Despite the absence of power forward Chris_Bosh , who has been sidelined with blood clots , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has held steadily onto fourth place in the Eastern Conference . Nights like Thursday certainly help , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot exquisitely from the field , posting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent including var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . On var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's side , meanwhile , rookie var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored a career - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . The 19 - year - old sharpshooter has made a big splash early on in his NBA career , capturing attention for his lights - out shooting and NBA-ready skill set . Despite being one of the youngest rookies , var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] is now just the second member of the 2015 draft class with multiple 30 - point games , joining first overall pick Karl-Anthony_Towns . In the absence of injured stars Eric_Bledsoe and var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] , the fresh - faced rookie has been handed the reigns to the offense , a role that he embraced with his team - high 21 shot attempts on Thursday . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] proved himself as a knockdown shooter , hitting var_player[1][3][FGM] of his shots including var_player[1][3][DREB] three - pointers and also going var_player[1][3][FTA] - for - var_player[1][3][FTA] from the free - throw line . Another young rising star in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , third - year center var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , played a team - high var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes and recorded a double - double , dropping in var_player[1][1][PTS] points and pulling down var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . It was a resounding loss nonetheless for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who have quickly become the NBA 's coldest team . With Bledsoe and var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] both inactive , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] looks destined to add another high lottery pick to their already young group of players . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit Orlando on Friday to face the Magic , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Philadelphia to take on the league - worst 76ers .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has won four straight games , and while the wins have come during an easy part of their schedule ( Sixers , Jazz , Nuggets , var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ) , the talking heads have tried to fit the narrative of Lance_Stephenson ( groin ) sitting out as the reason for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' success . Stephenson has missed the last four games , coinciding with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' resurgence , and while they have no doubt played remarkably better of late , putting all the blame on one player is misleading . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led with the way Tuesday , putting up a team - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will go on the road to face the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Friday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has dropped two straight and three of their last four games as they struggle to try and fill the hole of Jabari_Parker ( knee ) being out for the rest of the season . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] tried his best to keep the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in a position to win , putting up a game - high var_player[0][4][MIN] points in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( concussion ) returned from nine - game absence , putting up var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][PTS] rebounds in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . Despite dropping a few games recently , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have stayed competitive every night . They 'll go on the road to face the Atlanta Hawks on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) snapped a six - game losing streak on Sunday with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] win over the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . The win coincidentally ended a seven - game win streak for OKC . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] sits at fourteenth in the Eastern Conference , leading only the league - worst Philadelphia 76ers ; however , they were able to come away with a win against one of the association 's stronger teams on Sunday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been skidding all season , seeing coach Lionel Hollins fired and GM Billy King tender his resignation . On Sunday , they ended a slough of tough losses , advancing their record to 8 - 17 at home on the season . Star big man var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] caught fire on Sunday , pouring in a team - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points while pulling down var_player[0][2][FTA] rebounds . OKC defensive anchor var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] sat out Sunday 's contest with an injured right elbow , allowing var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] to take advantage of the defensive shortcomings of backup var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] was aided , however , by the hustle of power forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] . The veteran pulled down seven offensive rebounds and 14 boards in total , also notching 14 points , three assists , a block , and a steal . For var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , the loss comes as a bit of a shock considering the tear that the team had found itself on . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] boast the third - best record in the NBA , trailing only the historically good Warriors and Spurs . For var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's dynamic duo of superstars , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , it was business as usual on Sunday . The two combined for 59 points , 22 rebounds , and 14 assists . Both players were named starters for the Western Conference in this year 's All-Star game earlier this week . However , outside of the superstar tandem , only two var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] players cracked double - digit scoring , recording 10 points apiece . OKC was edged out at the line and on the glass , as they allowed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to pull down 18 offensive boards and var_team[0][TEAM-REB] in total . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will try not to let the loss affect them as they travel to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday to take on the Knicks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , will play host to the Miami Heat on Tuesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] received more than they likely bargained for from a feistly var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] squad that perhaps played with a bit more fire than usual , following var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's announcement earlier in the day confirming his retirement at season 's end . The perennial All-Star appropriately generated some late - game excitement with a clutch three - point shot that closed the deficit for the home team to 104 - 103 with 12 seconds left , but var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was able to seal the victory for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by draining var_player[1][1][DREB] out of var_player[1][1][REB] free - throws in the final var_player[1][1][FGM] seconds . It was fitting that var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] clinched the hard - fought win , considering that he spearheaded var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's offensive attack once again with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals over var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . It marked the third consecutive game that the standout forward has been at 33 points or better , including a 40 - point outing . The backcourt duo of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] also made solid contributions , with both guards posting double - digit scoring performances . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] amassed var_player[1][4][PTS] points and complemented it with var_player[1][5][PTS] rebounds , var_player[1][4][PF] assists and a pair of steals , while var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] pitched in var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and a block . After an up - and - down start to his var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] tenure , var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] has now posted double - digit scoring in var_player[1][3][FGA] of his last eight games . C.J . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] had a quiet outing by his recent standards , pouring in only var_player[1][0][PTS] points , and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] rounded out the starting five 's contributions with var_player[1][2][DREB] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards in another solid game . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] reserves with var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and a pair of assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They remain in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to face off with the Clippers on Wednesday . Outside of his brief moment of fourth - quarter glory , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] turned in another absolutely forgettable shooting effort . He shot only 20 percent from the field , needing all of 20 shots to reach his final output of 13 points . He also added four rebounds , three assists and a steal . Meanwhile , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's heir apparent at his old shooting guard spot , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , continued his recent strong play with an outstanding var_player[0][3][PTS] - point , var_player[0][3][REB] - rebound double - double . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , another var_player[0][1][AST] of the young stars giving var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' brass and fans hope for the future , tallied his third double - double in the last var_player[0][1][PF] games with var_player[0][1][DREB] points and var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] rebounds , with all but var_player[0][1][BLK] of those boards coming on the defensive glass . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued his inconsistent shooting performances , totaling var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field , and adding var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and a trio of assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a serviceable effort at the center spot , collecting var_player[0][2][PTS] points and hauling in var_player[0][2][REB] boards . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] surprisingly tied var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] for the team scoring lead with an unexpected var_player[0][6][PTS] - point night off the bench , following var_player[0][3][FG3A] consecutive games in which he 'd only mustered single - digit point totals . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - 13 and currently reside in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) extended their franchise record for wins in a season with a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] victory Friday against the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue to build themselves as a viable contender , remaining within striking distance of the Cleveland Cavaliers for control of the Eastern Conference . The All-Star backcourt of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] has played no small part , of course , as the duo 's members remain the top var_player[1][3][FG3A] scorers on the team . This held true on Friday , as var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] led the team and the game with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , complemented by var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] . Center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , came up big with var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and a whopping var_player[1][2][BLK] blocked shots . All in all , it was a solid yet narrow win for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who have built momentum heading into the postseason . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , is quickly falling in the standings after what has now been a five - game skid . The absence of star center Marc_Gasol has been a difference - maker , and will potentially put the Grizzlie 's fifth spot in the West in jeopardy . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] percent from the field on Friday , a significantly lower mark than their opponents were held to . Veteran big var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] offered up var_player[0][1][PTS] points , but did so on just var_player[0][1][FGM] - for - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting . Things look bleak for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] as the team remains riddled with injuries going forward . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will face one of the toughest matchups in the association on Saturday as they face the Spurs in San_Antonio . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , will host the Orlando Magic on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) benchwarmers var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came into this game as huge favorites as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] rested all five starters after an overtime game on Tuesday . That left the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] extremely shorthanded and they simply could n't score enough to keep pace with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . They trailed by 23 points at the half and it never got much closer after that . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is one of the best rebounding teams in the NBA and that was the difference here , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] pulled down var_team[0][TEAM-REB] boards to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] essentially decided to sacrifice a game to give their veterans a day off . The team really struggled with its long distance shooting , going 6 for 31 from three - point range . J.J.Barea carried the load in the loss , as he finished with 18 points and six assists . The candidate for surprise line of the night was var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_player[1][9][PTS] points and var_player[1][9][REB] rebounds , which both surpassed his season totals in those statistics . Look for all the regulars to be back on Friday for their next game against the Chicago Bulls . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were expected to dominate here and they took care of business . If there was var_player[0][4][OREB] blemish here , it would be that var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was ejected in the second quarter for accumulating var_player[0][4][STL] technical fouls . He failed to score for only the second time in his career . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up his game in var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's absence , though , scoring var_player[0][0][PTS] points while snatching down var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also had a nice var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will be big favorites in their next game as well when they play host to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took down the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] ) on Wednesday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , in a battle of two of the Eastern Conference 's most improved teams . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] became the first team in the league to match their win total from 2014 - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] on Tuesday , as defeated the Hawks for their 17th win of the season . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has now won three in a row , and sits just one game shy of .500 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' efforts were bolstered , as always , by the play of superstar var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] . After posting a big double - double in Atlanta , Melo continued to shine as he dropped in 25 points to go with five rebounds and four assists . Offseason acquisition var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] also posted an impressive var_player[1][2][PTS] points on var_player[1][2][FGM] - for - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting . Highly-publicized rookie var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , however , had an underwhelming night , posting just var_player[1][1][FGA] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting . The rookie got off to a ridiculously hot start to the season , but slowed down a bit starting in early December . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had been carrying a three game win - streak headed into their matchup against var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , who missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years last season , now sits well above .500 and leads the Southeast Division . Perennial All-Star var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] lit it up for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] against var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , knocking down var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] shots for var_player[0][1][PTS] points . Ultimately , var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's efforts were n't enough for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to get past Melo and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , however . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to turn things around on Friday as they travel to Phoenix to take on the struggling Suns . For the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , on the other hand , maintaining the win streak will be difficult , as they travel to San_Antonio on Friday to face off against the Spurs . San_Antonio remains a perfect 200 at home .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Staples Center on Sunday . As with many contests involving the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , the game was largely a defensive slugfest , with each team counting an var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - point effort as the high - water mark among their respective first units . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did the honors for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 20 ) and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][6][AST] - var_player[1][4][STL] ) , respectively , and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] were the only other players on either side to tally double digits in the scoring column . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , despite mustering only var_player[0][2][PTS] points , did make a key contribution to the hard - fought victory by bringing down var_player[0][2][REB] boards in a tough matchup against var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PF] assists , var_player[1][4][FG3M] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FG3M] steals to his team - high scoring total . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] turned in a near double - double with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , and he also produced var_player[1][2][FGM] assists and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] struggled throughout the night on offense , combining for 12 points on var_player[1][3][PTS] - for - 19 shooting . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] paced the reserves with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , which he complemented with var_player[1][6][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][6][PF] assists and a steal . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's final stat line consisted of var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , an assist and a steal . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was close to a double - double himself , supplying var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][PTS] assists , var_player[0][4][FG3A] rebounds and four steals . J.J. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] managed only var_player[0][3][PTS] points but no other stats , while var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] ' bench - leading effort consisted of var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][FG3M] rebounds and an assist . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] produced var_player[0][5][PTS] points , a rebound , an assist and a steal as the second - leading scorer among the reserves . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head to San_Antonio for a Tuesday night tussle , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to face off with the Suns on Monday night .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in a potential playoff preview matchup Monday at American Airlines Arena , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in overtime . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] sunk a pair of free throws with var_player[0][3][PF] seconds left to give var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] an 88 - 87 lead , but he fouled var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] on the other end with less than a second remaining to give the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] a chance to end it in overtime . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] missed the first , however , and the game went to overtime . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] sunk the first three field goals of overtime and never trailed in the extra period as they pulled out the victory . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG ) and added var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] played var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench and scored var_player[0][6][PTS] points , grabbed var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and blocked var_player[0][6][OREB] shots . Justice var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] filled up the box score as he earned big minutes in overtime , as he scored var_player[0][5][PTS] points , grabbed var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , dished var_player[0][5][PF] assists and swiped var_player[0][5][PF] steals . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] pulled off the victory despite awful shooting , as they mustered just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] - 100 from the floor and 2 - 13 from three - pont land ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3PT ) and added var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][1][PTS] points and added var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks , but fouled out in overtime . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starter in double figures , as he scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points on var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] missed nine free throws , including var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's critical last - second front - end miss , and shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent ( 16 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) from the line . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] return home to host the Knicks on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] continue their homestand Wednesday against Golden_State .
It 's been a rough , potentially final year for var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who has spent majority of this season nursing a sore Achilles . But Monday night against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] organization saw the var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] they had grown so accustomed to seeing for the var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] years he has been with the franchise . The German finished with a season - high 26 points on top of five rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes . It was a performance var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had n't had since the very first game of this season , when he scored 22 points and var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds in 38 minutes . On top of that , Monday 's performance was just the second time this season where he was able to shoot over 50 percent from the field . In the end , the good news for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] is that while his performance against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] feels like an outlier as of now , var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] appears to be trending in the right direction , having scored in double figures in var_player[1][1][FG3M] straight games .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) beat the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . The teams split a back - to - back , home - and - home series with each team winning on the road . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] played both games of a back - to - back set for the first time since December 26th and 27th , tallying a team - high var_player[0][1][DREB] rebounds in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] almost registered a triple - double , finishing with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][3][STL] steal and var_player[1][3][FG3M] three - pointers in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] Hilario , var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] all scored in double figures . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] struggled from the free - throw line , sinking 14 - of - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] shots overall . They now hold a var_player[0][4][STL] - game advantage over the Toronto Raptors for second place in the Eastern Conference var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] kept the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in the game with a team - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds , and var_player[0][4][STL] steal but did turn the ball over var_player[0][4][TO] times . Backup center var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][5][PTS] points in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes , grabbing var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds in the process . The team struggled from deep , converting 4 - of - 17 three - pointers , and now hold a one - game led over the Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons for eighth place in the Eastern Conference . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] do n't play again until Wednesday when they begin a three - game Western Conference road trip against the Sacramento Kings . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] take on the Philadelphia 76ers this Monday afternoon .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took care of the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday night . The game was tied at 25 - 25 after the first quarter , but it was never close after that . The difference in the game was as simple as shooting , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot 50 percent from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] came into this game with more talent and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came in with better teamwork and it 's clear that the teamwork prevailed here . The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] starters really killed this team as they were outscored by the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starter 70 - 27 in the loss . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] continues to surprise fans with their efficient play . They won this game in relatively easy fashion thanks to a great team effort . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] once again led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] did grab a season - high var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds in the win and that 's a great sign after his recent struggles . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] also had a good game off the bench , as he tallied 22 points , var_player[1][8][FTA] rebounds , var_player[1][8][FTA] assists , var_player[1][8][TO] blocks and var_player[1][8][TO] steals in the victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will have a much better test when they host the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday in their next game . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][1][PTS] points , but aside from that , the rest of the starting - five was a nightmare on Monday . The other four starters combined for just 11 points and had a terrible plus - minus . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had another nice game off the bench though , as he collected var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds in the loss . This is yet another 110 - plus points allowed and that 's been the issue all season long , as they rank dead - last in points allowed this season . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will have a few days off to think about this terrible performance , when they host the Washington Wizards on Friday in their next scheduled game .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) throttled the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was clearly angry after their 30 - point loss on Monday to the Golden_State Warriors and they let out their frustrations on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] here . This was a thorough domination , as they won each of the first three quarters by at least six points and carried a 20 - point lead into half and a 29 - point lead into the fourth quarter . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range in another shooting exhibition . That successful shooting can be credited to the assist margin , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] dished out var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[1][TEAM-AST] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were 9 - 3 over their last 12 games , but this is a different animal against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Not only did they allow the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to shoot nearly 60 percent from the field , they only made 38 percent of their shots . The only notable line was a var_player[1][3][PTS] - point outing from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , but he still committed var_player[1][3][FGM] turnovers and only dished out var_player[1][3][AST] assists in a down game . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] did return here after a var_player[1][2][FGM] - game absence , as he fell just shy of a double - double in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes of play . No other player on the roster scored more than 11 points besides those var_player[1][6][TO] and the hack - a - Caplea strategy on var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] became a huge issue as well , as he went just var_player[1][6][BLK] - for - var_player[1][6][FTA] from the free - throw line . It does n't get much easier in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's next game either , as they take on the Oklahoma_City Thunder on the road on Friday . Although the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] last loss cracked a var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - game winning streak , this win extended their home winning streak to an incredible 25 games . What 's most impressive about their home form is that they are defeating teams by nearly 20 points a game on average . Tonight was var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's night , as he tallied var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists in the victory . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] also played well , as they scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points a piece . Even though Tim_Duncan did n't play , the other four starters stepped up by combining for 76 points in just three quarters of action . Up next for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is a fantastic game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . The game featured another entertaining showdown between var_player[1][2][PF] of the best rebounding centers in the NBA , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] posted a second double - double in var_player[1][2][BLK] tries against his former var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] teammates , tallying var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . However , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] responded with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and a massive var_player[0][2][REB] boards . Despite the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] big man 's individual statistical superiority over his former frontcourt mate , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] easily won the overall battle down low , tallying 50 points in the paint ( compared to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) and outrebounding them var_team[1][TEAM-REB] to var_team[0][TEAM-REB] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][0][PTS] points , and the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] guard added var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][PF] assists . O.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] bounced back from a nightmarish var_player[1][3][TO] - point performance Wednesday to total a season - high var_player[1][3][FGA] points , along with var_player[1][3][FGM] rebounds , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and a steal . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] came within a rebound of a double - double , collecting var_player[1][1][PTS] points and hauling in var_player[1][1][REB] boards . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ironically could not muster the same type of production in a start as compared to when he comes off the bench , totaling var_player[1][4][FGA] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench , amassing var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][PF] rebounds . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and remains in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home for a Saturday showdown with Knicks . In addition to var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's mammoth outing , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] greatly benefited from a pair of var_player[0][4][PTS] - point efforts from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] . The former complemented his scoring with five assists , a rebound and a steal , while the latter added to his second consecutive 20 - point performance with four rebounds , three assists and a steal . Veteran forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , apparently beginning to hit his stride offensively , posted his third consecutive double - digit scoring game ( var_player[0][1][PTS] points ) . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] reserves with var_player[0][5][FGA] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] but remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They remain home for a date with the Lakers on Sunday .
In their first of var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] matchups against the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) this season , the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] prevailed with a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] win in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . First-year Spur var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the charge with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , 12 rebounds , and var_player[1][1][AST] assists . The All-Star forward took advantage of the weak play of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' big men , also tallying a block and a steal in 35 minutes of play . The game was a bounceback for var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] , who posted scoring totals of 11 and var_player[1][1][FTA] in his first var_player[1][1][TO] games . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's froncourt was also bolstered by the performance of 24 - year - old forward var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who totaled var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds to go along with a pair of steals and a block . Despite falling behind early , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to remain within reach throughout the game , due largely to the performances of a number of bench players .

However , as has often been the case this season , help from the rest of the starters was hard to come by . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who 's been the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' second most consistent source of scoring , did post his third consecutive performance with at least 20 points , amassing var_player[1][3][PTS] points and chipping in var_player[1][3][FG3M] boards , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and a steal . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] turned in var_player[1][5][BLK] of his typically solid nights off the bench , posting var_player[1][5][PTS] points of his own over var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dropped to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and reside in last place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home for another tilt with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] on Tuesday .

Veterans var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][1][FGA] points ) posted his best scoring night to date in a Mavs uniform , and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][PTS] points ) turned in an admirable performance against var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][PTS] points ) also reached a high - water mark in scoring with his new team , rounding out a balanced offensive effort for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

The Sixers learned this afternoon that standout rookie Jahlil_Okafor will likely miss the remainder of the season due to a torn right meniscus . This was a crushing blow for the already struggling team , as Okafor had been the team 's leading scorer up until this point . His absence did not seem to present too much of an issue , however , as it gave sophomore big man var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] the chance to take the reigns . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] stuffed the stat sheet for var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks , and var_player[0][2][STL] steals .

The rest of the team , however , has suffered largely from injuries and lack of veteran experience throughout the season , and it showed on Friday . The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bench went a combined 5 - for - 20 from the field with multiple players scoring no points in over 10 minutes played . The team as a whole shot just 38 percent from the floor , as they could not seem to find the basket whatsoever . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will take on Detroit on Sunday for the second half of a back - to - back . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , will see Milwaukee on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Amway Center .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will resume play Feb. 20 against the Heat . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to go into the All-Star break on a high note and avoided its 13th loss in 14 contests . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got strong performances from some unlikely players after var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had to leave the game with a dislocated finger . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][10][BLK] blocks in var_player[0][10][MIN] minutes before fouling out and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] put up var_player[0][7][PTS] points off the bench . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will return to action Feb. var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] against New_Orleans .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) pulled out an impressive victory on the road against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] found a sixth gear from the second quarter through the remainder of the matchup , dropping over 30 points per quarter and steadily building upon a halftime lead . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] put together a strong trio , and midway through the third quarter , there was not much the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] could do to match the pace var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was playing at . Six var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] players finished scoring in double figures , led by var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's team high var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steals across var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][3][DREB] assists in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes , while eight var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] players came off the bench to provide some rest for the starters in the fourth quarter . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had a quiet outing as compared to most of his campaign so far , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] point guard finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] aided var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] in double figures with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , but the starters were simply not able to find a rhythm , especially the front court . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] combined for a lowly 15 points and 17 rebounds . Both teams play on Friday , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] host the Memphis Grizzlies , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] visit the Houston Rockets .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( 40 ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday . This was a one - point game going into the final quarter , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] pulled away by winning the fourth quarter var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] in a defensive showcase . The biggest differential in the stat line was that the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] outscored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in the paint var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] . With the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' strength being their backcourt , it was not a huge surprise to see the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggle to contain var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] in this matchup , as both scored over var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points in the victory .

In the end , however , it was var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's defensive effort that guided them to victory , as the team tallied up var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] steals and forced the opposition into 15 total turnovers . Their opposition , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - 30 ) , struggled mightily offensively outside of their star var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with a game - high var_player[1][0][MIN] points on var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting from the field , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes .

Not only was he hitting shots , but he was making all the tough ones as well , including a three - pointer with a hand in his face at the buzzer to end the first half , putting the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] up 62 - 54 at the break . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][4][FTA] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from the three - point line to finish with a game - high of var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][4][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . His performance erased any doubts of how he 'll play during his first trip to the NBA playoffs . As a team , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] received a ton of help from the other var_player[0][0][PF] members of the `` Big Three `` , as both var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had strong showings . Like var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , this also marked var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's NBA playoff debut and he made it count with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][1][PF] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . His var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] rebounds helped give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] rebounding advantage over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][BLK] - var_player[0][7][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][7][FG3A] FT ) of his own , to go along with var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][AST] assists and var_player[0][0][STL] steals . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] did n't have to take this game over like he has in years past due to the impressive performance from var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] . With var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] having such a big game , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] was able to focus on getting his teammates involved , as his var_player[0][0][AST] assists were a team - high . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also received a solid contribution from their bench , as var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points ( var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][6][REB] FG , var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][6][REB] FT ) and var_player[0][6][FGA] rebounds in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes of tough play . Like he 's done ever since joining the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was again the most productive player for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][5][FGM] - for - var_player[1][5][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][5][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][5][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[1][5][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][5][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][5][AST] assists in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] had n't posted double figure assists even once previously this season , so the double - double was a very nice surprise for this team , despite taking the loss . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] will need to continue to play like this if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] want any chance in this series , but he 'll need to get more production from others , as he did n't get much help Sunday . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] did everything he could to help var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] and had a strong first half , but slowed down in the second to finish with var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FG3A] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][BLK] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][5][FG3M] blocked shots off the bench . Both var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures in points as well . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][FGA] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][PTS] FG , var_player[1][1][DREB] - var_player[1][1][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][PF] FT ) , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists , while var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][1][PF] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came out in the first quarter playing extremely hard and looking like the more motivated team , but they were n't able to hold off the more talented and experienced var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , who eventually got into a groove and were just too much for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . These two teams will play again on Tuesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in double overtime Tuesday . Through three - plus quarters , the stage appeared set for a hard - fought var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] victory . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] held a 68 - 60 advantage heading into the final period , and was looking to put away a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] team playing its third game in four nights and coming off a challenging contest versus the high - octane Oklahoma_City Thunder on Monday . However , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] crawled its way back on the strength of rousing fourth - quarter performances from var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] to tie the game at 96 with var_player[1][5][FG3A] seconds remaining on a var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] 23 - foot three - point basket . After var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] sank a jumper with var_player[0][4][STL] seconds left in regulation , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] appeared to have sealed the win . However , a driving layup by var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] at the buzzer sent the game into its first extra period . After an initial overtime that saw both teams fail to score after var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] tied matters up at 104 with 30 seconds remaining , they battled through a second extra period , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] taking a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - 109 advantage with 1:20 on the clock .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division .

Despite a huge late game effort , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] just did n't have enough left in the tank to finish the comeback and suffered a tough three - point loss in front of their home fans . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] received a huge effort from their starting five in this one , with all reaching double - digits in points . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , going var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][4][PF] - for - var_player[1][4][FTA] from the free throw line .

In var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's attempt to avoid only their third defeat since Nov. 26 , their next test is a bit stiffer Friday against the Oklahoma_City Thunder .

Shooting 40 percent from the field and a miserable 20 percent ( 5 - for - 25 ) from three - point range Wednesday , nary a Pacer found his groove offensively . While starting point man C.J . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] managed var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds , and var_player[1][1][FTM] assists , the frontcourt trio of var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] combined for var_player[1][2][MIN] points and 14 rebounds .

The duo combined for 47 points , but it took 45 shots , and outside of the strong shooting in the fourth quarter , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] ended up going var_player[0][4][FTA] - of - var_player[0][4][PTS] from the field . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] aided the guards in the front court with var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) are still tied with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 5 - seed in the Western Conference , but pulled out a needed win with opening day starters on the court . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] single handedly took the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_player[1][4][PTS] ) to overtime after draining a var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - foot var_player[1][4][TO] - pointer to bring the game within var_player[1][4][AST] points with :36 remaining in the fourth quarter , and then finished the job at the free throw line on the next possession to tie the game at 113 points a piece .

It 's rare to see a game with just four ties have neither team capture a double - digit lead , but that was just the case here . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] actually held the lead for the majority of the game and they took care of business at the free - throw line , shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent . T.J. var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] led the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as he scored var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team , providing var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][5][AST] assists and var_player[1][5][FTA] steals off the bench . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FTA] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and a pair of blocks and steals . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the player pf the game , as he tallied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][AST] assists and var_player[0][0][BLK] blocks on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team , scoring var_player[0][8][PTS] points on var_player[0][8][FGM] - of - var_player[0][8][FGA] shooting off the bench . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] also played well off the bench , providing var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][AST] assists , var_player[0][5][TO] steals and var_player[0][5][BLK] blocks .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had looked rather hapless on Sunday against the Timberwolves while playing with a significantly short - handed squad . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] and Paul_Zipser all missed that contest , and matters did n't look much more optimistic heading into Tuesday 's tilt . However , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] was able to ultimately make a return from his heel injury , and his presence unsurprisingly made a considerable impact . The star forward posted a 19 - point , 12 - assist double - double that also included var_player[0][5][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][5][FG3A] steals over a full allotment of 38 minutes , and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] actually led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - point effort off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also overcame var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers by shooting a solid var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were led by var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who produced var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FG3M] assists , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steal . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][PF] rebounds , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][FG3A] steal . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] generated var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][FGM] assists , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][7][STL] steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a near double - double of var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was productive as a reserve as well with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][FGM] rebounds , var_player[1][5][PF] assist and var_player[1][5][PF] steal . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][AST] assist to his aforementioned team - high scoring total . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][DREB] boards . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][AST] assists and var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][8][PTS] points , var_player[0][8][FGA] rebounds , var_player[0][8][AST] assist and var_player[0][8][FTA] steals . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] registered matching var_player[0][4][PTS] - point efforts on the starting var_player[0][4][PF] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to take on the Boston Celtics on Thursday night .
Despite big performances from var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were unable to overcome a rash of turnovers as they fell to the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] by a score of var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] benefitted from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' turnover troubles , scoring var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points off of var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] scored 11 unanswered points to secure a 13 - point lead at the half . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] cut the lead to six points late in the fourth , but were unable to close the gap down the stretch . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] posted the third double - double of his last var_player[1][2][PF] games . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] scored a game - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points , giving him back - to - back games with over 20 points .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Tuesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Staples Center on Saturday afternoon . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were looking to extend a recent winning stretch that had seen them emerge victorious in three of their previous four games , but knew they 'd have a challenge in the form of the considerably improved Sixers ( 23 - 42 ) . That came to fruition throughout the first three - plus quarters , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] actually entered the fourth period in possession of a 79 - 75 advantage . However , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] came alive at that point , outscoring their visitors by a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - 21 margin in the final 12 minutes to secure the double - digit win . Four members of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] first unit managed to score in double digits , and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting , along with var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . The Sixers were led by var_player[1][5][PTS] points off the bench from var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , a total he supplemented with var_player[1][5][DREB] rebounds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] paced the first unit with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][1][BLK] block . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][DREB] boards , var_player[1][2][DREB] assists and var_player[1][2][STL] steals . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . T.J.McConnell generated nine points , 10 assists , one rebound and two steals . var_player[1][3][FIRST_NAME] Luwawu-Cabbarot matched var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's scoring total and added var_player[1][3][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][4][REB] assist and var_player[1][4][REB] steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] followed var_player[0][12][FIRST_NAME] with a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[0][2][PF] assists , var_player[0][4][PF] steal and var_player[0][4][DREB] blocks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double that also featured var_player[0][1][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][OREB] steals . J.J. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] played an effective complementary role , pouring in var_player[0][3][PTS] points and adding var_player[0][3][FTA] rebounds , var_player[0][3][REB] assists and var_player[0][3][REB] steals . Mareese var_player[0][9][SECOND_NAME] led the second uniit with var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][FG3A] boards and var_player[0][9][FG3M] assist . The Sixers remain in California to take on the Lakers on Sunday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head to Utah for a Monday night tilt versus the Jazz .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) held off the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to win var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season , but they could n't quite hold off the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ended the game on a 20 - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes . Not to mention , that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's bench was a bright spot though , as they outscored var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's bench 47 to 26 . This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . They had a big lead early , but simply could n't hold on . They did get var_player[1][5][STL] great bench performances , as var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] dropped var_player[1][5][PTS] points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's best player on this night was rookie var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][TO] steals en route to a double - double . The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding . They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] looked horrible in the first half , but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] got an outstanding performance from var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][STL] steals in the victory . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] also had a great game , as he collected var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks in the win . Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he 's truly playing at a different level this season than years past . This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to keep up their strong defense against the surging New_York Knicks on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 20 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland in game var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] of their first round matchup of the Western Conference playoffs . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got off to a really quick start in this game , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] in the first quarter , as both var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] finished the quarter in double figures . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] then got a huge spark off the bench in the second quarter from var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored 10 of his var_player[0][6][PTS] points during that span , helping get the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to a three - point lead at the break .

Including scoring 14 in the fourth quarter , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] finished the game with a team - high of var_player[0][3][PTS] points , as he shot var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][FG3M] - for - 9 from deep . With var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] playing so well early on , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] did n't have to do much in the first half , but he really turned it on near the end of the game with a clutch performance in front of an electrifying crowd at Oracle Arena . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , posted var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][PF] - var_player[0][4][PF] FT ) , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists over var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . He did n't score at all in the fourth quarter , but he did n't need to with var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's emergence . Another player that came up huge for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] was var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who time after time made the big play to get the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] their momentum back . He notched a double - double and did a little bit of everything in the win , finishing with 14 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , 12 rebounds , five assists , two steals and two blocked shots . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds as well , helping give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 42 rebounding advantage . Along with helping the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] get the strong start , both var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] ended up as the team leaders in scoring . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTA] - var_player[1][1][FTM] FT ) , var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][STL] blocked shots , while var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - 19 FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] was having his way with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt early , but they stepped it up in the second half and held him in check . After feeling a pop in his left knee during game var_player[1][4][PF] of this series on Saturday , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had to leave that game and he never returned . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was back in the lineup Monday though and the injury did n't look to hold him back , as he finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][OREB] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][AST] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FTM] assists in a near triple - double effort . If the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] want to get over the hump and come out with a victory in this series , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] will need to step it up even more in game var_player[1][4][FG3A] . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] provided a nice contribution off the bench as well , scoring var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][OREB] - var_player[1][6][PF] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FT_PCT] - var_player[1][6][FG3M] FT ) in 27 minutes . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] was really the only bench production for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] though , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' bench was much more effective Monday . These var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] teams will now head to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to play game three of the series on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) held on to knock off the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) behind var_player[0][0][PTS] points from var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] on Friday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] trailed by as much as var_player[0][0][FG3A] midway through the fourth quarter , but var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] stepped up down the stretch , scoring eight straight points in less than var_player[0][0][FTA] minutes to put the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] up 92 - 90 with 2:54 to play . Following a var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] free throw , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] fed var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] for a dunk to bring the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] lead to var_player[0][4][TO] . Then , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] leading by var_player[0][6][FTA] with 23 seconds to play , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] found var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] for a var_player[0][6][REB] - pointer that would prove to be the dagger . In his second game with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][STL] steals in var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , and var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] poured in var_player[0][0][PTS] points to go with var_player[0][4][FTM] assists and var_player[0][0][REB] boards . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] player in double - figures , finishing with var_player[0][1][PTS] points in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was paced by var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points from var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][FG3_PCT] from var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][1][PTS] points to go with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][6][FGA] points and var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds off the bench . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who continues to start in place of the injured var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] , scored just var_player[1][2][PTS] points but had var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][REB] blocks . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] now has 25 blocks over his last var_player[1][2][DREB] games . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue their road swing in Houston on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] receives an extended break and will not play until Thursday , also in Houston .
These are two offenses that ca n't get anything going , so they decided to turn to their benches . In fact , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had their bench score var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] points , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's bench combined for 45 points of their own . The var_player[1][6][STL] leading scorers came off the bench too , as var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] dropped var_player[1][6][PTS] points in his second game with the Mavs and D.J . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][7][PTS] for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The backcourt of var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] apiece , but they combined to go 8 - of - 23 from the field . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's stars were n't any better , as var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined to go 8 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] from the field . Amazingly , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - of - 28 from three - point range , which was half of their makes for the evening ( 26 - of - 77 ) . Rebounding was the big difference in the game , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] snatching down var_team[0][TEAM-REB] boards to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ' var_team[1][TEAM-REB] .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) fought off a second - half rally from the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to win var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday . Despite being outscored by 13 in the third quarter , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to narrowly pull out a win in the game 's final minutes . All-Star point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] not only led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] , but dished out his second - highest assist total of the season with var_player[1][4][AST] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] played a whopping var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes in four quarters and turned the ball over just once despite being the focal point of the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] offense . Meanwhile , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's backcourt partner in crime var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] drilled var_player[1][4][FG3A] three - pointers and poured in var_player[1][3][PTS] points overall . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] shot a disappointing var_player[1][3][FTM] - for - var_player[1][3][FTA] from the free - throw line , but more than made up for it with his impressive shooting from the field ( var_player[1][3][FG3A] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] ) and his stellar defense ( var_player[1][3][STL] steals ) . Overall , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] won with a lights - out shooting performance from beyond the arc , as the team shot 16 - for - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] from deep . Rebounding , however , proved to be an issue for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as they pulled down just var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] boards to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-REB] . Superstar var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was unsurprisingly the leader for his team on Tuesday , as he posted a game - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points to go along with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . Melo hit three three - pointers and was perfect from the line , helping his team post an impressive 53 percent from the field . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] saw help in the form of Latvian rookie var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][1][PTS] points and blocked var_player[0][1][DREB] shots . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggled , however , to match their opponents ' heat from beyond the arc , as they shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point territory . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will see their last contest before the All-Star break on Thursday as they visit Milwaukee . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , are done until after the break . They resume action in Brooklyn on Feb. 19 .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came in to Sunday 's contest badly in need for a convincing victory against a quality opponent , as they 'd lost six of their last nine games , and had struggled to put away a significantly short - handed Brooklyn Nets squad until the fourth quarter on Friday . Things did n't seem to exactly be pointing in the right direction early on Sunday , as var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was forced from the game after var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes with back spasms . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) also held a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] lead after var_player[0][4][STL] quarter , but var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned things up a notch during the second period . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] outscore OKC by a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] margin over that span , building 58 - var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] lead heading into halftime . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] also turned in outstanding supporting efforts in the win , and the Cavs managed to hold their visitors to 37 percent shooting from the field , and a 23 percent success rate from three - point range . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did manage to record yet another triple - double , but was `` contained ' to a manageable var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][FG3M] steal and var_player[1][4][BLK] block , shooting just var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] did n't fare much better , posting var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( on var_player[1][3][DREB] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting ) , var_player[1][3][REB] boards and var_player[1][3][FTM] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[1][2][PTS] points but also hauled in var_player[1][2][REB] boards , along with var_player[1][2][FTA] assist and var_player[1][2][BLK] block . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][FTM] assist . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] paced var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] assists , var_player[0][4][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][STL] steal . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] supplied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] boards , var_player[0][0][AST] assists and var_player[0][0][PF] steal . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] contributed a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , 12 - rebound double - double that also included var_player[0][2][PF] assist , var_player[0][2][STL] steals and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . Reggie var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][FG3A] steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have another tough matchup on tap , as they now head to San_Antonio to tangle with the Spurs on Tuesday evening . Meanwhile , the Cavs head to Dallas to face off with the Mavericks on Monday night .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( 20 ) were able to pull away on the road from the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in the second half of Friday 's game , winning by a score of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . The two teams were dead even through the first two quarters , as the score was tied 26 - 26 after the first 12 minutes and 54 - 54 at halftime . However , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] eventually used an 80 run in the third quarter to gain separation from the opposition , and maintained that advantage over the final 15 minutes . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was a star performer off the bench for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , notching var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points on var_player[1][7][FGM] - for - var_player[1][7][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] knocked down var_player[1][0][TO] three - pointers to finish with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] both shook off poor shooting nights to combine for 37 points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were undone by the lack of scoring from their starting unit , as only two of the five starters reached double figures in scoring . That offensive deficiency was further exacerbated by the team 's ineffectiveness on the glass , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] outrebounding var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] by a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] count . For the second straight game , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] leaned on var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] to drive the offense , and the guard did n't disappoint with a team - leading var_player[0][5][FG3_PCT] points and var_player[0][5][FGM] assists . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][REB] boards off the bench , while fellow frontcourt reserve var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[0][6][PTS] points of his own . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will come at home Sunday versus Milwaukee , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will enjoy another home date that same day against San_Antonio .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at American Airlines Arena on Saturday evening . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came out flat on the second night of a back - to - back , resulting in their second straight loss . They shot 38 percent from the field and only 2 - of - 15 from long range . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on the other hand , came out on fire , with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point first quarter and won the second quarter var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - 15 , to take a 59 - 41 lead into halftime . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] then held on through the second half to earn their fourth straight win and come one step closer to a spot in the top eight in the East . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the high - point man for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , with var_player[0][3][PTS] points on var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting , including var_player[0][3][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][3][FGM] from deep . Five other players scored in double digits for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , including var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who chipped in var_player[0][4][PTS] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] had his night cut short after var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes of action , as he took a hit in the eye , which resulted in swelling . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] double - doubled , with var_player[0][5][FGA] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , to go along with var_player[0][2][FTA] blocks , in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][5][PTS] points on var_player[0][5][FGM] - of - var_player[0][5][FGA] shooting , in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to keep rolling , as they face the second game of a back - to - back in Indiana on Sunday . Meanwhile , despite shooting var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the high point man for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , with var_player[1][3][PTS] points in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] got the start in place of var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][DREB] shooting , and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , in only var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce back and avoid a third straight loss , as they play host the Mavericks on Monday .
Over the last five games , var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] star var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] has been absent due to a knee contusion , and that opened the door for backup center and former No . 3 overall draft pick var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] to prove his worth to the organization - - or other organizations for that matter . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] has played in var_player[1][2][REB] of those five games , as he sat out for precautionary reasons in var_player[1][2][TO] , and in those var_player[1][2][REB] games , he 's given mixed results . While offensively var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] has been somewhat productive in averaging 14 points per game following his var_player[1][2][PTS] - point performance Monday , he has n't done so at a very efficient rate . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] has failed to shoot over 50 percent in three of those var_player[1][2][REB] games , and considering how he does the majority of his work near the basket , shooting 46 percent overall in that stretch is not a very impressive mark .
var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's red - hot start continued Tuesday , with his var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting tally from the field and var_player[0][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] mark from beyond the arc leading the Cavs to record 52 and 50 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was markedly more efficient than the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] from the charity stripe , successfully converting var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] of their 31 free - throw attempts . They out - rebounded the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by a 46 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] margin as well , in large part due to var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] combining for half of that tally . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue to lean heavily on var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , who once again paced the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points while setting up another var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - plus through his var_player[1][4][AST] assists . The remainder of the starting var_player[1][3][PF] outside of var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] continues to struggle to muster consistent offense , however , and went a combined 11 - for - 28 from the field .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] Friday . 2015 top overall pick var_player[1][2][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] ' coming out party spearheaded the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to a rousing victory over var_player[1][2][TO] of the more potent offenses in the NBA . The standout rookie posted his second double - double in as many games and was dominant on the defensive glass in particular , hauling in 11 of his 14 boards on that end of the floor . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] ' deft 59 percent shooting ( 17 - for - 29 ) over his first var_player[1][2][AST] career games has also been an eye - opener . The Wolves also enjoyed a nice rebound effort from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who had struggled mightily with his shot in the opener . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] poured in var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] points to supplement var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] ' outstanding effort , and var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's bench with var_player[1][9][PTS] and var_player[1][2][REB] points , respectively . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] could not come close to duplicating their shocking road victory over the Rockets in the opener , enduring mediocre shooting nights from their starting five . First-round pick var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] paced var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points and did cut down his turnovers to a respectable var_player[0][4][TO] after being charged with 11 in the opener . However , reserve var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] outscored the rest of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' starters with var_player[0][5][FGA] points over var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes , while the normally prolific var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] could only contribute var_player[0][0][PTS] points on a subpar var_player[0][5][FG3A] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting performance . Overall , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was only able to muster a mediocre var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] team field goal percentage in the loss . The victory keeps the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] perfect at 20 and in first place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They now head to Portland to face the Blazers on Monday . The loss drops the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and places them into a last place tie in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They next head to Oklahoma_City for a showdown with the Thunder on Sunday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at Madison Square Garden in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . While the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have already been eliminated from playoff contention , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue to sit comfortable in the top half of the Western Conference standings . They currently remain two and a half games above the Houston Rockets for the second seed in the West , but also trail the Golden_State Warriors by seven games for the top overall seed . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were the much better shooting team in this game , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and an impressive var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ended at just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and a meager var_team[0][TEAM-AST] percent from deep . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' starting frontcourt came up big again Monday , as they combined to score 56 of the var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] total points . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the way , finishing with a team - high of var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , to go along with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FTM] assists . He 's played well of late for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and is averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last five games . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] also had a strong showing , posting var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds over var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] shot just 27 percent ( 4 - 15 FG ) from the field during Saturday 's game against the Portland Trail_Blazers , so it was good to see him have a lot more success on Monday . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][0][BLK] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGM] FT ) and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds as well . It was var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] who provided a nice push off the bench . var_player[1][8][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][8][PTS] points ( var_player[1][8][FG3M] - var_player[1][8][FGA] FG , var_player[1][8][FG3M] - var_player[1][8][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][7][OREB] - var_player[1][7][OREB] FT ) in var_player[1][8][MIN] minutes , while var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG ) and var_player[1][7][FGM] rebounds in var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did his best to keep the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in this game , going var_player[0][3][REB] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][PF] - for - var_player[0][3][AST] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][3][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][3][FG3A] assists . He had combined to go var_player[0][3][AST] - for - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] from the floor and just var_player[0][3][STL] - for - var_player[0][3][FGM] from deep over his last var_player[0][3][PF] games , so it was a breath of fresh air for var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' fans seeing var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] shoot a little better Monday . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] did his part as well , posting var_player[0][2][FGA] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][DREB] - var_player[0][2][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][2][FG3M] - var_player[0][2][TO] FT ) and var_player[0][2][FTA] blocked shots in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . He 's been one of the more consistent players for this team , averaging 17 points , 4 rebounds and one blocked shot during his last 10 games . With var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] sidelined with a rib injury , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] moved into the starting lineup , but he contributed just var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][AST] FG , var_player[0][4][STL] - var_player[0][4][BLK] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in 43 minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][5][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][REB] FT ) and var_player[0][1][FTM] steals , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench for var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][BLK] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][FTM] - var_player[0][5][REB] FT ) and var_player[0][1][PF] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Wednesday .
While the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] won and ended their eight - game losing streak , they by no means put together a perfect performance . In fact , the game 's result simply came down to the fact that even in spots where var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] struggled , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] somehow found a way to be worse . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot a fairly poor var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent overall from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] managed to shoot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] struggled to make it to the free throw line , shooting just 13 attempts and only making nine of them ( var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent ) . And while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] did get to the line more often , shooting 25 shots from the charity stripe , they made just var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent of those . Where the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] excelled was in taking care of the basketball , committing just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers on the night , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] still found a way to be better there , committing just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] beat the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Friday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . It was the season debut for banged - up var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] star var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] missed the majority of the preseason and the team 's season opener with a bruised knee , but was able to transition back into a limited role for Friday 's contest . The forward came off the bench for an impressive 15 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes , but showed some signs of rust , turning the ball over five times . His typical frontcourt partner , French var_player[0][2][DREB] - footer var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , made a major impact on the defensive end with var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][2][OREB] offensive rebounds also helped the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] overcome a poor perimeter shooting night , offering var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] a number of second - chance attempts . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , received troubling news , as rookie var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was forced to leave the game with a knee injury after just var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes of play . Though not appearing to be serious , the second overall pick will likely be monitored closely going forward . It was a tough night for young var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in general , as guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] went just var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] from the field , while forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored just var_player[1][1][PTS] points and recorded only var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did manage to find a scoring boost off the bench , as sixth man var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][9][PTS] . Both teams will travel on Sunday , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] visiting the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] Clippers and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] taking on the Thunder in Oklahoma_City .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite only having var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] victories on the year , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] put up a fight and kept even with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] all the way up until the start of the fourth quarter . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to use a significant rebounding advantage and superior shooting to out - score the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] in the final quarter , thus sealing the nine - point victory at home . With DeMarcus_Cousins still sitting out with an illness , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] continued to take the lead for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . He shot 10 - for - 19 from the field and 0 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 29 points . He also got to the free throw line 10 times , and was able to convert on nine of those attempts , pushing his season scoring average to 21 points per game . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was an important piece in the victory . He scored 16 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and handed out six assists in 32 minutes , as he also was continued to be relied upon to make up for the loss of Cousins . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had arguably his best game of the season , as he recorded a season - high of var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FG3M] - var_player[0][5][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][FTM] - var_player[0][5][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] failed to receive very much production from their bench , therefore putting it on the shoulders of their starters . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][AST] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][0][AST] assists , while also matching a season - high with var_player[1][0][STL] steals .

He 's combined for 38 points , 12 rebounds and six assists in the previous two games , giving the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] a little bit of everything . Both var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points , but it was n't enough to propel the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] past the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Los_Angeles Lakers on Tuesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will play the San_Antonio Spurs at home on Tuesday as well .

Former Buck var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points as he shot a blistering var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the floor and made both his three - point attempts . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] recorded adouble - double with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][AST] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3PT ) , dished var_player[0][3][AST] assists and swiped var_player[0][4][FTM] steals . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and added var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][BLK] steals and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was outshot by the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] notched an absurd 19 steals and turned the ball over just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] times themselves . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] led all scorers . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG ) and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][1][PTS] FG , var_player[1][3][DREB] - var_player[1][3][FTM] FT ) dropped var_player[1][0][PTS] points apiece , and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][1][PF] - var_player[1][1][DREB] FG ) scored var_player[1][3][FGA] points , grabbed var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , dished var_player[1][1][AST] assists and blocked var_player[1][0][TO] shots . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field but just 3 - 15 ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) from three - point land and committed fewer assists ( var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) than turnovers ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) .

The second game of a back - to - back for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] proved to be a heavy workload , as the team looked tired throughout the second half . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] ( shoulder ) started , but only played the first half , likely to give the crowd a sendoff in his final game in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . It was far from a pretty showcase between the two teams , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] received another strong performance from rookie point guard var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , who scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting , to go along with var_player[1][4][BLK] rebound and var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] assists in var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] minutes . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has broken through in the second half of the season , and heading into Wednesday , he had posted a var_player[1][4][FTA] game stretch averaging var_player[1][4][FGA] points , 4 rebounds , var_player[1][4][FTA] assists on 55 percent shooting .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will host the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) on Friday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held on to win , but it looked bleak after surviving an eight minutes stretch of play between the third and fourth quarters where they scored an underwhelming two points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot 1 - of - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] during that stretch , and save for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] inability to rebound the ball , the eight minute stretch could have been extended . The unlikely hero came on the back of D.J . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] , who rallied the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] after the scoring drought and finished with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][7][AST] assists and var_player[0][7][PF] steal on var_player[0][7][FGM] - of - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] shooting in var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes off of the bench . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] put together a strong game , and the rookie matchup with var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] made for the most entertainment , as he rounded out the box score with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] all finished in double figures in their starting roles . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Brooklyn Nets ( 17 - 44 ) on Friday .

In an unsurprising turn of events , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the big story in Monday 's game between the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . `` The Little Guy `` finished the night with 35 points and extended his league lead on fourth - quarter scoring with a whopping 17 points in the final 12 minutes . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] shot var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] including var_player[0][4][FG3M] made three - pointers and added var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][DREB] assists on the night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also saw strong play from All-Star center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who toyed with the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] frontcourt en route to an efficient var_player[0][2][PTS] points in var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes . After a season - best night in Atlanta on Friday , bench big man var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] came up huge once again , scoring var_player[0][5][PTS] points to go with var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] continued their barrage of three - point shooting , making var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] threes and shooting a flat var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field on the night . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , saw a relatively underwhelming offensive night . Point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points but shot just var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] . Big man var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored an efficient var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] lagged behind var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] in shooting with only var_team[0][TEAM-REB] percent from the field with var_player[1][1][FGM] three - pointers .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite being out - scored var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] in the final quarter , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to hold on to a five - point victory and push the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] losing streak to five straight games . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to secure a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] rebound advantage in this one , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] could n't handle the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bigs . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers Tuesday . He scored 23 points ( 10 - 20 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) and grabbed eight rebounds , pushing his season averages to 15 points and 5 rebounds per game . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] stuffed the stat sheet as well . He finished with 22 points , eight rebounds , six assists and three steals . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] was able to go a perfect var_player[1][1][FTA] - of - var_player[1][1][FGM] from the free throw line , as he led the team in attempts . The third starter to reach double figures was var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] shot var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][4][DREB] - for - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][4][PTS] points . He had a brutal game shooting the ball against the Bulls on Sunday , so it was good to see him have a bounce back game . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] had a tough day from the field . He shot 7 - for - 22 from the floor and a dismal 1 - for - 7 from beyond the arc to score 20 points . He also tied a season - high with nine reobounds , while chipping in six assists . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] on the other hand caught on fire a bit in this var_player[0][3][DREB] . He shot 7 - for - 9 from the field and 5 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 19 points , while also recording seven assists . It was only the second time he 's reached double figures in points , although he 's only participated in six games this year . Amare var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] was moved into the starting lineup , and had a solid all - around game . He scored 17 points and grabbed nine rebounds in 37 minutes on the floor . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench did n't give them much of a boost . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the San_Antonio Spurs on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will play at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , on Saturday night at Quicken Loans Arena . The Cavs remain undefeated as they held on to avoid a collapse against the feisty var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Despite having not won a game yet this season , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fought hard and right down to the wire in this one . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] battled back from a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - point deficit at halftime to make it a three - point game with about var_player[0][3][OREB] minutes left but J.R var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] responded with back - to - back three - pointers , to put the Cavs back in control . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) was led by the superstar tandem of var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who combined for 43 points , on the second night of a back - to - back . Meanwhile , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][1][PTS] points and J.R. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][3][PTS] , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] took care of business in the paint , hauling in var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . The Cavs will have a couple days rest before they are back in action on Tuesday when they host James_Harden and the Rockets . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have had a rough start to their season but that can somewhat be expected of a team that is sporting a new look ; while , having to face the defending champs after a couple of tough losses is certainly an extra challenge . Nonetheless , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] put up a fight as they battled back to give the Cavs a scare late in the fourth . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][3][PTS] points in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] look to nab their first win of the season when they visit Philly to take on the 76ers on Tuesday .
Injuries have led to var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] playing a much bigger role in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to start the season than the team originally planned , and while he 's already had var_player[0][3][TO] double - digit scoring performances , his efficiency has been subpar . His performance Tuesday night was yet another example , as var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] shot just var_player[0][3][TO] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field ( var_player[0][3][FG_PCT] percent ) . That marks the seventh time this season where the shooting guard has shot under 33 percent from the field , and he is shooting a horrid 31 percent overall . On the other side of the ball , var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shooting guard var_player[1][5][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] Jr. has seen a small reemergence in his fourth NBA season , as the former Michigan star 's var_player[1][5][PTS] points on Tuesday marked the fourth time he 's reached that total this season . He scored 15 points just four times all of last season , but has now become a crucial part of the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bench , averaging 13 points per game so far .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took down the ailing var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - 43 ) at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday , winning var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . It was a big night for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's veteran backcourt , as guards var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 46 points . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] led the team in scoring while also pulling down var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and committing just var_player[1][3][TO] turnover in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes of played . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , meanwhile , added an impressive var_player[1][4][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists on top of his var_player[1][4][PTS] points . The true star , however , was bench big man var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who delivered a massive var_player[1][7][PTS] - point , var_player[1][7][REB] - rebound double - double while also swatting var_player[1][7][BLK] shots . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has continued to climb in the standings despite the absence of All-Star Chris_Bosh . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have ascended to third in the East while their star struggles with recurring blood clots . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , has been dealings with injury issues of its own . The struggling var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took a major blow earlier this weak when it was announced that star forward var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] would miss the remainder of the 2015 - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] season . A battered var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team took the floor on Tuesday , with var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] getting the nod at power forward . It was a tough night all - around , as the team shot just 39 percent . The injured squad did find a leader in point guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points while recording var_player[0][3][FTA] assists and var_player[0][3][STL] steals . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will go on to visit San_Antonio on Wednesday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will travel to Indiana on Thursday .
On Friday , veteran Maverick var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] returned from injury in surprisingly big fashion . Despite being limited to just var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes on the floor , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points and shot var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] . Forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , scored a team - high var_player[1][1][PTS] points and shot an impressive var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] . The team shot only 42 percent on the night , but was able to make up for it with strong defensive play . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to force var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] turnovers by the end of the night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] felt the absence of All-Star Blake_Griffin on Friday , as the team 's starting five scored just 34 points combined . Superstar var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] also sat out the game , leaving little in the way of offensive production for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Sixth man var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] did provide some start , contributing var_player[0][6][PTS] points off the bench .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Wednesday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) earned a much - needed win thanks in large part to the play of center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] scored a new career high with var_player[0][2][PTS] points on a mind - boggling var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - 14 from the field . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][2][AST] of the front - runners for the Defensive Player of the Year award , also blocked var_player[0][2][BLK] shots and pulled down var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds . The ridiculous efficiency the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got out of var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] lifted the team 's shooting percentage to a respectable var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent despite cold nights from a number of other players . This included a var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting night from All-Star forward var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] . Another area in which the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] excelled was turnovers . The team coughed the ball up just seven times on the night . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has struggled mightily of late and looks poised to finish in the lottery yet again as the season comes to an end . var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fans did see hope for the future exhibited on Wednesday , as sophomore big man var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had an excellent outing . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and also pulled down var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds .

P.J . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] was forced to come off the bench as punishment for missing the bus to Friday 's shootaround . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] still played var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes and finished with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][STL] steals . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the man to replace var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] in the starting lineup . He and his twin brother Marieff var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] each had var_player[1][1][PTS] points in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . All var_player[0][1][FGM] var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] players that came off the bench scored in double figures on Friday , however var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the lone starter to accomplish that feat .

var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double led the way for the Cavs , who 'd rested Kyrie_Irving on Tuesday .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite already having been eliminated from the playoffs , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished with another solid win Tuesday , pushing their streak to three in a row . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot much worse from the field and three - point line than the Sixers , but were able to force them into var_team[0][TEAM-AST] turnovers , while committing just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] of their own , so that ended up being the difference in this one . They also had a large advantage from the free throw line , converting on 30 - of - 38 attempts , while the Sixers made just 13 - of - 21 . It was the duo of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] who led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to this win . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] was nearly unstoppable , finishing with a game - high of var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FG3M] - var_player[0][2][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][2][FTM] rebounds , var_player[0][2][STL] steals and var_player[0][2][STL] blocked shots . It was the third game over his last five where he scored 30 points or more , as he 's been an absolute force . During that five - game stretch , he 's averaging 26 points , 13 rebounds and a block , while shooting 48 percent from the field . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , went var_player[0][1][FGM] - for - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][1][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][1][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][1][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][BLK] blocked shots . He 's also been very consistent with his production of late , and is averaging 26 points and 5 rebounds over his last five games . The only other King in double figures was var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][BLK] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][PF] FT ) and added var_player[0][4][FG3A] rebounds as the starter at point guard . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] shot the ball well Tuesday , going var_player[1][1][FGM] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][1][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][1][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[1][1][PTS] points . He had really been struggling offensively over his last four games , shooting less than 35 percent from the field in three out of those four , so it was refreshing to see him have much more success this time around . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] came out and notched a double - double , finishing with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][PF] - var_player[1][2][REB] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][PF] FT ) , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocked shots . He 's on a solid stretch of seven games , where he 's averaging 15 points , 9 rebounds and two blocked shots , so that trend continued Tuesday . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][7][PTS] points and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds as well , as he went var_player[1][7][FGM] - for - var_player[1][7][FGA] from the field in just var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes of action . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday , while the Sixers will travel to Denver to play the Nuggets on Wednesday .

Five players shot at least 11 field goals and all five scored in double digits . Forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][1][PTS] points and 11 rebounds . The team held a major advantage in the turnover column , committing only nine while forcing var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to turn the ball over var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] times . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , relied heavily on var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] who combined for 40 shot attempts . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was a dismal var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field and had var_player[1][4][TO] turnovers . var_player[1][10][FIRST_NAME] , meanwhile , led the team per usual with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds , and var_player[1][0][FGM] assists . The outing was not enough to earn the win or make up for the absence of injured All-Star var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] , however .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] Thursday at Talking Stick Resort Arena . The win for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] ) ended a three - game losing streak and elevated them into a tie for the worst record in the Western Conference with the Lakers . The game managed to stay rather close through the first 36 minutes , but then the home team turned it on in the final period and outscored var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] by 14 points .

Overall , it was a great shooting performance from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they managed to hit a scorching var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . As for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , Thursday 's defeat marked their worst loss since early February against the Rockets , and they now sit three games behind the Pistons for the No . 8 seed in the Eastern Conference . To make matters worse for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , var_player[1][2][FIRST_NAME] Kaminksy left the game in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury and did not return after scoring var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way scoring for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] added var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points of his own . The problem for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] lied in their bench , as the eight reserves who saw the floor Thursday managed to score just 23 of the team 's var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] points . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will remain home Friday to take on the Thunder , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head to Denver on Saturday to take on the Nuggets .

That was on display Monday , as var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] co - led the team with var_player[0][0][PTS] points on a combined 18 - of - var_player[0][2][MIN] shooting . Meanwhile , while Monta_Ellis sat out the contest with a groin strain , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was able to provide a scoring lift off the bench in his stead , pacing the second unit with var_player[0][5][PTS] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) saw their first unit turn in lackluster showings overall . They were led by a pair of var_player[1][3][FGA] - point efforts from var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , with the former adding var_player[1][1][FG3M] assists , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FG3M] steals while the latter hauled in var_player[1][3][REB] boards and dished out var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] generated a modest var_player[1][4][PTS] points and supplemented them with var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][STL] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steals . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] went for var_player[1][0][PTS] points but did bring down var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][PF] rebounds , var_player[1][0][STL] assists and a steal . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] complemented his var_player[0][0][PTS] points with var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FG3M] assists and a steal , while var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[0][2][REB] boards , a steal and var_player[0][0][TO] blocks . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][AST] - assist double - double that also included var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and a steal . Glenn_Robinson got the start for Ellis , but only provided three points , along with six rebounds , two assists , three blocks and a steal . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] turned in var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][DREB] boards and an assist , while var_player[0][9][SECOND_NAME] was also productive off the bench with var_player[0][9][FGA] points , var_player[0][9][DREB] rebounds , an assist and a pair of blocks . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hit the road again to face off with the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head down to South Florida to face off with the Miami Heat on Wednesday evening as well .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) outlasted the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) in a tight one Wednesday night at the Amway Center , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . It all came down to a wild fourth quarter which included three ties and five lead changes . A var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] layup with var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] seconds to go gave the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a 94 - 93 lead they would not relinquish . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting and added var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds , including var_player[0][2][OREB] on the offensive glass . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] pulled down 17 offensive rebounds as a team , the main reason they managed to escape with the win despite a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting night . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][3][PTS] points and shot var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from three - point land . var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with game highs in points ( var_player[1][2][PTS] ) and rebounds ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) as he earned his third consecutive double - double . Began var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] scored var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points , but was part of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' struggles from three - point range , as he shot var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][REB] from var_player[1][3][PF] and the team managed just var_player[1][3][PF] - var_player[1][3][PTS] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have won just two of their last 10 and finish a three - game road trip Saturday against Boston . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have now won four of five and will try to stay hot New Year 's Day against the Wizards in Washington .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has won two straight and var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] of their last ten games . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored a game - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] ( back ) was held out . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] started at point guard in his place and finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][FTA] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . Six players scored in double digits for the Mavs , including var_player[1][8][PTS] points from var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench . They continue their road trip with a lighter meal against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had their six - game win streak snapped with this loss , but more devestating was that var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had to leave the game with a left groin strain after var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes of action , and his status going forward is unclear . Louis var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] picked up the backcourt slack with var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] out . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][6][PTS] points in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench , while var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] put up var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][AST] assists in var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will embark on a var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - game road trip that begins in Los_Angeles on Sunday against the Lakers .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the Staples Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Coming out of the third quarter , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] surprisingly held a 77 - 75 lead . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] picked it up in the fourth quarter though , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] to end the game and seal the var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - point victory on the road in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this one , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] percent from the field and just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also turned the ball over var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] times , while forcing the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] into just eight . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] did the bulk of the work offensively for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . He went 12 - for - 22 from the field and 5 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 31 points , while adding three assists in 38 minutes . He had a brutal showing against the Golden_State Warriors on Friday , where he shot just 14 percent ( 2 - for - 14 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt ) from the field , so it was good to see him get back on track Sunday . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][1][FGA] points ( var_player[1][1][FG3A] - var_player[1][1][PTS] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][FGM] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds in 26 minutes . He has n't been scoring much lately , as he 's averaging just 13 points over his last four games , which is far less than his season average of 17 points per game . Also scoring less than his season scoring average was var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who recorded just var_player[1][0][FGA] points ( var_player[1][0][DREB] - var_player[1][0][PTS] FG , var_player[1][0][PF] - var_player[1][0][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][TO] - var_player[1][0][PF] FT ) and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . Like var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] , he 's been playing poorly offensively of late and is averaging just 10 points over his last var_player[1][1][REB] games . Despite their performances though , they were still able to come out with the win and end their two - game losing streak . Rookie var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had a solid game in the losing effort , finishing with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][REB] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][BLK] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][DREB] FT ) , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . It was his second strong showing in a row , as he 's coming off a 25 - point , six - assist performance Friday . Over those two games , he 's shot a combined 18 - for - 31 from the field , as he looks to be dialed in and more confident than he 's been all season long . Also doing his best to help the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] stay in the game was var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , who came off the bench for a team - high of var_player[0][6][PTS] points ( var_player[0][6][REB] - var_player[0][6][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][FTM] - var_player[0][6][STL] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][6][FGM] rebounds in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 13 points and 8 rebounds as he continues to be the veteran leader of this team . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] shot well , going var_player[0][0][FGM] - for - var_player[0][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][0][AST] - for - var_player[0][0][DREB] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][0][PTS] points . He 's combined for 29 points and nine rebounds over his last two games . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][OREB] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][3][PF] rebounds as well . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has won var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] straight games . Every team on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' schedule through their first var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] games is a projected playoff team , excluding the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] of course . Their schedule begins to loosen up some in the next couple weeks with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] facing several lottery - bound teams . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] could n't do anything on offense against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] shot just var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field to finish with a season - low var_player[0][3][FTA] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will finish off their current four - game roadtrip Saturday against the Kings in Sacramento . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has a day off before hosting the Golden_State Warriors on Sunday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bounced back from a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] first - quarter deficit to limit the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to 27 points over the second and third periods . However , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] won the final 12 minutes by a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] margin , erasing var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - point lead and sealing the improbable win . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][4][PTS] points paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[0][3][PTS] points . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] produced a var_player[0][1][FGA] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] shot just var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] on the way to a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point tally . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's scoring total and hauled in var_player[0][5][PTS] boards , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with an var_player[0][5][PTS] - point total . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][2][PTS] points led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was next with a near double - double of var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] turned in var_player[1][3][PTS] points , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] hauled in var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][5][PTS] points led the bench .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was coming off of two straight losses , and with the winless Sixers looking for a win , this looked like it might turn into a tough game for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( calf ) made his season debut and was slotted directly into the starting lineup . He finished with three points and three assists in 21 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will begin a three - game road trip in Houston on Monday against the Rockets . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost var_team[1][TEAM-AST] straight to begin the season , and while the struggling var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] looked like a chance for the Sixers to finally secure their elusive first win of the season , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] showed that they are n't quite as forlorn as the Sixers . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had the best game of his rookie career Saturday . He put up 17 points and 12 rebounds in 39 minutes . The Sixers will return home to host the Portland Trail_Blazers on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the TD Garden in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . In a relatively sloppy game with 37 combined turnovers , it was the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] who were able to come into var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and steal an 11 - point victory . They were the superior shooters as a team , going 48 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot just 41 percent from the field and a paltry var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] percent from beyond the arc . With the higher shooting percentages , as well as a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 36 rebounding advantage , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to seal the win . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's re - emergence this season coninued Wednesday with a var_player[1][1][PTS] - point ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][1][REB] - rebound performance . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] sat out all but var_player[1][1][TO] games last season with a broken leg , but is now putting up career numbers to start the year , averaging 24 points , var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][1][FG3M] steals over 36 minutes per game . The double - double also marked his fifth on the young season already , so var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] is showing some serious production . C.J . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] saw extended time with var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] out due to an ankle injury . He took advantage of the extra minutes , scoring 17 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , to go along with five rebounds and two steals . In injury related news , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did see one of their top young prospects leave the game . Rookie var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] suffered a sprained thumb in the first quarter and was forced to sit out the rest of the game . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] made his much anticipated return to the court after sitting out the last three games due to a toe injury . Coach Brad Stevens had him come off the bench , where he struggled to just eight points ( 1 - 6 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) and two assists over 21 minutes . Considering Avery_Bradley was sidelined with a leg injury as well , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] were the make - shift backcourt for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . They were the most productive players on the court , as var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][BLK] - var_player[0][3][BLK] FT ) and var_player[0][3][REB] assists , while var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][AST] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][4][FGM] assists . The var_player[0][3][PTS] points were a season high for var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] , who 's now scored in double figures in four straight games . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with an var_player[0][2][PTS] - point ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][STL] - var_player[0][2][FG3A] 3Pt ) , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double as well . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will remain at home in a matchup with the Atlanta Hawks on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] ) took down the struggling var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Friday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have remained solidly in the Western Conference playoff picture despite losing multiple starters to free agency this offseason . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has been boosted by small forward var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] ' return from injury . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][0][PTS] points against var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] while also pulling down var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds . Georgian center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , whose campaign for the NBA All-Star game nearly landed him a starting nod , also notched a double - double , recording var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hold the third - worst record in the NBA , and do not hold their own draft pick next year ( Boston received var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's unprotected 2016 pick as part of a previous trade ) . Despite these negatives , the team has seen bright play from var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] in the frontcourt . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] led the game with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and grabbed var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] posted an var_player[1][1][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][FGM] - rebound double - double while grabbing var_player[1][1][STL] steals . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will travel to New_Orleans on Saturday to take on the Pelicans . Meanwhile , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will play host to Phoenix on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in a sloppy game on Tuesday . In a battle of two of the worst defenses in the NBA , the offenses played poorly . It 's not like the defenses played well either , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot just 41 percent from the field . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] did shoot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent , but committed an ugly var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers in the win . There were a combined 30 steals and 49 turnovers in the game and those are not far off from NBA records . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into this game in the second half of a back - to - back and they played tired . There were numerous possessions where players were standing around and way too many defensive lapses when there was simply no defense being played at all . The team was outrebounded 47 to 36 and shot just 31 percent from three - point range . Those are indications of a tired team , but the effort simply was n't there . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was spectacular yet again though , as he tallied var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][DREB] assists in the defeat . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will have a good opportunity to bounce back when they take on the Los_Angeles Lakers on Thursday in their next game . It 's not too often a team commits var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers and wins , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] managed to pull that off somehow on Tuesday . They played without var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] , but all the other starters filled - in nicely in his absence . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the starting point guard for this game and played extremely well , accumulating var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds in the win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] also stepped up in var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] 's absence , totaling var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] also chipped in for some great games , as they combined for 36 points , var_player[0][0][PTS] rebounds , nine assists and var_player[0][0][FGM] steals in the victory . This was a great team performance from var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and it 's nice to see everyone chipping in without var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] in the lineup .

Superstar point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] returned from injury and posted a line of var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds , and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] only shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent and had just seven three - pointers .
var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , while his clutch var_player[0][1][STL] - pointer with var_player[0][1][FGA] seconds remaining and block of var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's attempted game - winning trey insured the win . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] went for a near double - double with var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] boards . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][7][PTS] points off the bench . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] produced var_player[0][4][PTS] points , but var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] could only supply a combined var_player[0][4][FGA] points . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][1][PTS] points paced the Sixers . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , but the remaining var_player[1][3][FGM] members of the first unit failed to hit double digits in the scoring column , as var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][PTS] points ) , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][PTS] points ) and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][4][FG3A] points ) under - performed on the scoreboard .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have considerably struggled throughout the season defending opposing shooting guards . This surprisingly held true when Bradley_Beal , who has a good reputation on the defensive side of the ball , was healthy , and has persisted while he 's been sidelined over the last two - plus weeks with a lower leg problem . The deficiency reared its ugly head again Wednesday against one of the top two - guards in the NBA . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , and added var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][PF] steals and var_player[0][3][STL] blocks . He drained 17 of those in the first half , a total that partially consisted of a perfect 8 - for - 8 performance at the free - throw line . He preserved the pristine effort from the charity stripe in the second half , finishing 15 - for - 15 for the game . The visitors were led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , Jr. , who tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and a pair of assists , his second straight var_player[1][0][PTS] - point - plus outing . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed with yet another double - double , managing var_player[1][4][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][4][AST] assists . He also produced seven rebounds , five steals and a block in a terrific all - around effort . It was var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's seventh straight double - double , as he continued his stellar play during Beal 's extended absence . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][1][PTS] points ) and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][PTS] points , nine rebounds ) also made solid contributions , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was highly efficient in pacing the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , seven rebounds and var_player[1][6][FTA] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dropped to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They will head home to face the Orlando Magic on New Year 's Day . With respect to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters , it was essentially var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] and not a whole lot else . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][PTS] point , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][5][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][4][STL] steals ) was the only other front - line player that amassed double - digit scoring , while var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] were both outstanding off the bench . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] collected var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][FGM] rebounds while var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] produced a double - double in his first game back in a reserve role , tallying var_player[0][6][FGA] points and hauling in var_player[0][5][REB] boards . The man that he 'd been replacing while he healed from a broken hand , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , posted var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and continue atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a New Year 's Day showdown against the Charlotte Hornets .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Verizon Center on Wednesday . The back - and - forth tussle between two relatively evenly - matched teams was undecided until the closing seconds , as both teams made respective strong pushes in the second half .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received a var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][AST] - assist double - double from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] that also included var_player[0][4][STL] rebounds and an outstanding var_player[0][4][FTM] steals , although he also turned the ball over var_player[0][4][TO] times himself . Backcourt mate var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was close behind with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , 12 - rebound double - double that also featured two assists , two steals and a block . var_player[0][1][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] , Jr. supplied var_player[0][1][PTS] points , six rebounds , an assist and var_player[0][1][PF] steals while drawing a start for the ailing var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] ( foot ) , while Otto_Porter totaled 10 points , five rebounds , var_player[0][1][PF] assists , var_player[0][1][PF] blocks and a steal . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to produce var_player[0][5][PTS] points , seven rebounds , var_player[0][5][FTM] assists and var_player[0][5][OREB] steals in just var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] won this game in the fourth quarter , where they went on a huge run to out - score the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] .

He went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 20 points over 29 minutes . Like var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , he 's been relied upon to pick up the slack without Cousins and var_player[0][10][SECOND_NAME] , as he 's averaged 16 points over his last var_player[0][0][FG3A] games . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] came up with a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point ( var_player[0][2][FTA] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double , while also recording var_player[0][2][BLK] blocked shots .

Rookie var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was again var_player[1][3][BLK] of the few var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to have some success . He went 10 - for - 21 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 23 points , to go along with five rebounds , six assists and five steals . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] has already earned himself a role for this team next year , but he continues to improve his numbers late in the season , averaging 22 points and 7 assists over his last var_player[1][3][FG3A] games . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] also played well in the loss , finishing with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][PF] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . It marked his third straight game with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points or more , as he 's pushed his season averages to var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points and 2 assists over var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] games with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came into Wednesday 's contest missing big man var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] , who 'd been suspended for his part in a fight with the Raptors ' Serge_Ibaka on Tuesday evening . His absence was potentially hurtful , as var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] had been playing a much larger role in the offense following Dwyane_Wade 's season - ending elbow injury . However , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who 'd shown flashes of offensive prowess during his limited opportunities in Denver and Oklahoma_City , stepped up in his spot start to post var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][2][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][2][STL] steal .

var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the story coming into Sunday 's matchup and he did n't disappoint . Not only did he score a career - high 31 points , he hit a game - winning jumper with just 0 seconds left . He was n't the only var_player[0][3][TO] in a revenge game though , as var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points against his former team . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added to his absurd averages , as he tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in the defeat . This game was full of swings , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] led by 21 in the first half , before the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went on a 17 - 2 run in the third quarter to take a brief lead . While var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] did shoot over 50 percent from the field , they really struggled with threes and free - throws . In fact , they shot just 28 percent from three - point range and 61 percent from the free - throw line . There were 116 combined points in the paint , as defense became an optional facet of this game .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took down the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Monday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has had a disappointing start to the season but received a confidence boost with a strong win on Monday . Reigning Rookie of the Year var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . The Wolves ' other var_player[0][3][TO] young studs , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , also turned out impressive performances . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] delivered var_player[0][0][PTS] points , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] dropped var_player[0][3][PTS] including var_player[0][0][REB] three - pointers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had an astounding night from the free - throw line , making var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - of - 25 from the charity stripe . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) continues to struggle as well , falling to the second - worst record in the Western Conference with the loss . Despite the team 's troubles , guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] has impressed . On Monday , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points and came away with var_player[1][4][BLK] steals on the defensive end . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also saw strong play from their bench , as guard var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] dropped var_player[1][6][PTS] points and went var_player[1][6][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][FGA] from the field .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] found out earlier in the afternoon that they 'd lost starting power forward var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] for the night , due to a suspension stemming from his forearm shot on Al_Horford in Wednesday night 's contest versus the Hawks . The ripple effect of his absence brought var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] into the starting lineup for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , which could have used their All-Star big man , particularly during a valiant effort to close their deficit in the second half . Although they found themselves in a 56 - 46 hole at the half , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did finish with a healthy total of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] points due to a number of valuable contributions across the lineup . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] held up his end of the bargain trying to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] offense running on all cylinders , coming within a rebound of a second consecutive triple - double and fourth in var_player[1][4][PF] games .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They next head to Orlando for a date with the Magic on Saturday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] benefited from strong bounce - back efforts from their var_player[0][3][FG3A] veteran stars , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] . The All-Stars had each suffered through middling performances versus the Timberwolves on Tuesday , but took advantage of their respective favorable matchups against var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] .

Much like his var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shooting guard counterpart var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] turned in an impressive performance in a reserve role for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , pacing the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench with var_player[0][7][PTS] points over var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division .

This result snaps a three - game losing streak for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and a two game winning streak by the Cavs .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] assisted on var_team[0][TEAM-AST] of their 41 field goals while their defense held the Cavs to only var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long range and forced var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] into 15 turnovers . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had a very solid outing , with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][STL] - var_player[1][0][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][TO] FT ) , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][DREB] assists and var_player[1][0][FG3M] steal , in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes of action , but it was not enough to get his team over the hump in this var_player[1][0][FG3M] . Only var_player[1][0][PF] other players scored in double digits other than var_player[1][0][FIRST_NAME] , including var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who shot var_player[1][0][REB] - var_player[1][4][FGA] , on his way to var_player[1][0][FGM] points , and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who shot var_player[1][0][DREB] - var_player[1][1][FGA] , for var_player[1][1][PTS] points .

That was thanks in large part to an incredibly hot shooting performance from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from behind the arc . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were once again led by a pair of great performances from their starting backcourt , with var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] posting a game - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , while var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points of his own .

For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , Wednesday 's defeat marked their second loss in their last three games , and it was thanks in large part to their lack of defense , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was pretty solid on the offensive side of the ball .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] won by the definition of team effort and the scoring outburst from their bench .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who fell below scoring average , which is good for fifth in the league this year , but still turned in var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][TO] rebounds on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting .

All-Stars var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] also saw significant contributions in the points column , posting var_player[1][4][PTS] and var_player[1][0][PTS] respectively . The Cavs ended up winning the game at the free - throw line , where they shot a whopping 27 for 29 , and on the boards , where they held a 47 - 39 rebounding advantage and held league leader var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] to just var_player[0][2][REB] .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) could hardly have been blamed for potentially coming in to Monday with a bit of a hangover from their last game , a heartbreaking 113 - 112 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] saw a 112 - 111 lead go by the wayside at the buzzer courtesy of a Marcus_Morris tip - in , and they were facing another formidable challenge in the form of a surging var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) squad that had won three in a row .

Otto_Porter , Jr. contributed a 14 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also included two assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] put forward a modest var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards , along with an assist , a steal and a block . var_player[1][6][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] , Jr. led the second unit with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][DREB] rebounds , an assist , var_player[1][6][FTA] blocks and a steal . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FTM] assists , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and a block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][AST] assists and a steal to lead the bench . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] followed with matching var_player[0][2][PTS] - point efforts , with the former adding var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][PF] assists , var_player[0][2][STL] steals and var_player[0][1][STL] blocks , and the latter supplying var_player[0][1][REB] boards , var_player[0][1][DREB] assists , var_player[0][1][FTM] steals and a block . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][0][FGA] points , var_player[0][0][REB] boards , an assist and a block , and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a relatively quiet game by his standards , especially on the scoreboard , posting var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][DREB] assists and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face off with the Boston Celtics on Tuesday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to face off with the Golden_State Warriors on Wednesday night .

It may have been the worst night of the season for All-Star var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who shot just var_player[0][1][BLK] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] for var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][FTA] rebounds . Center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , however , had a double - double with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] boards .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) squeezed out a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] victory over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held a three - point lead into the final possession following a basket from var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , but a huge offensive rebound by var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] after a var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] miss helped give var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] the win . The loss for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] snapped a four - game win streak and var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] , who was questionable to play due to an illness , finished with just nine points and var_player[1][0][PTS] rebounds . It was only a matter of time before the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] would crack and perhaps their downfall was due to no one truly stepping up and taking the reins . By the end of the game , var_player[1][6][FGA] players had scored for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , but var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with var_player[1][6][FG3_PCT] points ( var_player[1][6][PF] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FG3M] - var_player[1][6][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FG3A] - var_player[1][6][FTA] FT ) over var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] returned to the lineup after getting the night off Monday against the 76ers , scoring var_player[1][2][FGA] points in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] really struggled from beyond the arc , finishing 7 - of - 26 to a tune of 27 percent in the game . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] not only sealed the win with a big board , but had var_player[0][3][OREB] of his best offensive performances of the season , scoring a game - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FTA] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) to go along with var_player[0][3][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . He stuck to what has made him a successful scorer , taking high - percentage shots while working his way to the free throw line consistently . Playing with a short bench with var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] sidelined again , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got a big boost from var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] FG , var_player[0][1][FT_PCT] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FT_PCT] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] FT ) while pulling down var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds over var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] continue their six - game homestand Friday against the Bucks ; the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for a date with the Lakers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) blew out the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday night . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were simply fantastic offensively in this matchup , as they shot over 50 percent from the field and accumulated var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists as a team . The third quarter was when the tide turned for both teams , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] scored var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points in the quarter , which included an 180 run . This was an utter domination in nearly every statistic , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had more rebounds , assists , steals , blocks and less turnovers than the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the win . Point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] might have had his best game of the season on Saturday for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and it was all for nothing . He tallied 27 points , four assists and two steals on 11 - of - 15 shooting in under 30 minutes of action . The problem for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was that the only player who scored more than 13 points was var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and that simply wo n't get it done against a team like the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . They also shot below 65 percent from the free - throw line and all that makes for a recipe of disaster . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has a few days off until they play the Minnesota Timberwolves in a very winable game on Tuesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were at top form on Saturday , as they outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by 16 points in the second half . They played some typical var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] basketball , as they dished out var_team[0][TEAM-AST] team assists , while shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] who scored a team - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points in the victory . The bench was spectacular as well , as they got var_player[0][8][PTS] points from var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][6][PTS] points from var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and a near triple - double from var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to carry this sparkling form into Monday 's matchup against a struggling Sacramento Kings team .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Neither team shot very well in this matchup , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] still had the slight advantage , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and a meager var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to use a strong first half , out - scoring the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 48 - 40 , giving them enough of an advantage to secure the victory in front of their home crowd . With Kevin_Durant sitting out with a sprained toe , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] did most of the shooting Monday , going var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field to score var_player[0][4][PTS] points in 30 minutes . It may not have been his best performance shooting the ball , but it was still enough to push the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to a victory . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] is averaging 24 points over his last var_player[0][4][FTM] games . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong showing as well , scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] 3Pt ) and grabbing a ridiculous var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . The double - double was his third in a row , while the 19 rebounds were a new season - high . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got a lot of help from their bench though . Both var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FG3M] - var_player[0][8][FGA] 3Pt , var_player[0][8][FTA] - var_player[0][8][STL] FT ) and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][8][FGM] - var_player[0][8][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][FG3M] - var_player[0][5][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][7][FTM] - var_player[0][8][STL] FT ) scored var_player[0][7][FG3_PCT] points , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][5][PTS] ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][OREB] - var_player[0][8][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][7][REB] - var_player[0][5][FGM] FT ) points . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] were the biggest reasons that the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to stay competitive in this game . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][3][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][DREB] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][0][FGM] rebounds , while var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][STL] steals . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] has had an impressive couple of games in a row , combining for 48 points , 14 rebounds and 10 assists over that span . He 's starting to find his groove , after not living up to expectations so far this season . The only other Timberwolve 's player to reach double figures in points was var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who came off the bench for var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][FG3M] - var_player[1][7][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][7][PF] - var_player[1][7][REB] FT ) and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] did n't have his best showing offensively with only var_player[1][1][PTS] points , but he was still an animal on the boards , recording var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in 35 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's next game will be on the road against the New_York Knicks on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Smoothie King Center on Monday . In a battle between Western Conference bottom - dwellers , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to prevail with a big win in a close - fought battle . There were 16 ties and 13 lead changes in total , with neither team leading by more than 10 . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] finished the game strong , as they ended the game on a 15 - 5 run . Defense was key for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they forced 16 turnovers and recorded a combined 22 blocks and steals . Three-point shooting was the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] downfall , as they went just 5 - of - 27 from long distance . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have now lost seven of their last eight games , as they continue to struggle .

Of course , the lead on offense came from point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting and dished out var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] is the league leader in assists while also ranking fifth in scoring . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] hit var_player[0][5][REB] three - pointers off the bench and now ranks just var_player[0][5][STL] var_player[0][5][REB] - pointer made behind Steph Curry for the league lead . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , saw struggles on offense , shooting just 42 percent and var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] percent from three . Point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , however , did not struggle , scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] points along with var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] is the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' leading scorer at over var_player[1][4][FGA] points per game .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were expected to win this game easily , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had other ideas . The rebounding differential was glaring to say the least , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] winning that battle , 58 - 33 . The bench production was a huge part of that , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's bench grabbing var_team[0][TEAM-REB] rebounds , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's bench snatched down just eight boards . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot over 50 percent from the field , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] could n't crack var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was at MVP form , as he accumulated var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][BLK] steals and var_player[1][4][BLK] blocks in the win . var_player[1][9][FIRST_NAME] Hernangonez was huge off the bench , providing var_player[1][9][PTS] points and var_player[1][9][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] also scored var_player[1][1][PTS] , with var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] scoring var_player[1][0][PTS] a piece . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] carried the load for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , collecting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] points , var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] did provide var_player[0][2][DREB] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists , but went just var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] from the field .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) used a balanced attack to overcome the powerful var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) by a score of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had a strong first quarter and jumped to a var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] lead but var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] won the next three quarters , including a definitive var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] fourth quarter . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had six players score in double digits and an impressive var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists on 35 made field goals . var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] Milsap led the way with a big double double consisting of var_player[1][1][PTS] points on var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTA] from the foul line and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the engine for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FTM] from deep , and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in just var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][FTM] rebounds , the big man shot an efficient var_player[1][2][FG3M] - var_player[1][2][FG3A] from long range . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] played despite being considered doubtful with a sore ankle and played well , finishing with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][PF] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FG3M] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also had six players score in double digits but shot a poor 43 percent from the field as a team . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the high point man for the Grizz with var_player[0][4][PTS] and dished a generous var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][1][PTS] points in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes , shooting var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] from deep . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] saw some extended minutes and took advantage with var_player[0][8][PTS] points on var_player[0][8][FG3M] - var_player[0][8][FGA] shooting from the field , including var_player[0][8][FG3M] - var_player[0][8][FG3A] from long range . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] also chipped in var_player[0][6][PTS] points off the bench . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] was missed as he sat this one out with a sore knee . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will be back in action on Saturday night as they continue their road trip with a game in San_Antonio . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will have a day off before hosting Philadelphia on Sunday .
var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[0][6][PTS] points in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench , but it was not enough to secure a victory , as the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went on to claim the road win at Staples Center . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] capitalized off sharing the ball , noted by their var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists as a unit , and that all five starters finished in double figures scoring . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's efforts on both end of the floor continue to drive the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , and he went on to finish with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] once again led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring , although the volume of shots was not perfectly in sync with the output , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] managed var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][DREB] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steals on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting , including var_player[1][0][FG3M] shots buried from behind the arc .

But with four seconds remaining and an 89 - 86 lead , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] committed a turnover on an inbounds pass . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] hit a free throw to close the gap to var_player[1][2][STL] , and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] missed the first on the other end , leaving the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][5][FTM] seconds to find a var_player[1][2][FGM] - pointer to tie the game . With no time outs , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was forced to bring the ball all the way up the court , but he drained a shot from half - court to force overtime . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were unable to carry that momentum into the extra period , however , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] opened overtime on a 60 run . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was unable to get its offense restarted , as they did n't score in overtime until there was 1:14 remaining . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] hit var_player[1][4][FG3M] three - pointers and scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG ) to lead all scorers .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot just 5 - 21 ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) from three - point land and managed just four offensive rebounds , and their inability to create offense outside proved to be their downfall in overtime . Game 2 of this series is scheduled for Thursday at 8:0 PM Eastern Time at Air Canada Centre .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took care of the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday to rebound after their first loss . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] looked timid for the first 20 minutes of the game , but turned it on after that . They trailed for the majority of the first half , until Steph var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] caught fire and the team won the second quarter by 15 points . The most amazing stat is that the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] scored 79 points in the second and third quarters to run away with a dominant victory . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot an amazing var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and recorded var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists in the blowout victory . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] first meeting with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] was a similar result and they simply ca n't stop this potent offense . Aside from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points , the other var_player[1][3][FG3A] starters combined for just 19 points . The bench did play well though , as var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][6][MIN] points and T.J. var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][5][PTS] . The team has won just four games in their last 15 and the defense is really killing them right now . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to play better in their next game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday . Steph var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] sat for the ninth time this season in the entirety of the fourth quarter and that stat alones tells the dominance of this team . Prior to sitting for the final 12 minutes , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . He was n't the hero tonight though , as var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] dropped 27 points in the third quarter en route to a var_player[0][3][PTS] - point night . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also provided yet another triple - double and it appears that var_player[0][1][BLK] loss was a blip on the radar rather than a sign of future struggles . It 's scary to think what they 'll do to the Milwaukee Bucks in their next game on Friday , who ended their historic streak earlier in the week .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][1][FG3M] late free throws and key defensive rebound as time expired sealed a hard - fought road win . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and a steal . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] went for var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] delivered a full stat line of var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][STL] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists , var_player[1][1][PF] steals and a block . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] drew the start in place of Dwight_Howard and managed var_player[1][2][PTS] points . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][6][PTS] points paced the second unit . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][REB] - rebound double - double . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][FGA] points ) and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][FGA] points ) rounded things out for the starters . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][7][PTS] points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were guilty of var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers overall .
After allowing a massive var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in the first quarter , the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) secured their third victory in four games with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] win over the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . Superstar var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] dropped in a game - high var_player[0][1][PTS] points , helping propel the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to victory . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] has flown under the radar in the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' disappointing season , despite his impressive averages of 23 points , 11 rebounds , and var_player[0][1][OREB] blocks per game . `` The Brow `` currently sits at fourth in the league in double - doubles this season , and has been a major part of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] Orlean 's increasing success as of late . Point guard var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] also exploded off the bench in the win over var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , delivering var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][AST] assists in var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes of action . The former All-Star has averaged 18 points and 10 assists over his last three games while turning the ball over just four times in total . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's season has deteriorated rapidly , as the team has now lost seven straight on the road . Rookie sensation var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] continues to be a bright spot in the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' unpleasant season . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] has posted rookie - best averages of 16 points and 10 rebounds per game , numbers which he added to in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The rookie center tallied 20 points , 13 rebounds , a block and a steal in the loss to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Reigning Rookie of the Year var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , led the team with var_player[1][3][PTS] points and also grabbed var_player[1][3][STL] steals . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next matchup takes the team to Dallas , where they will face the Mavericks to round out a double - header on Monday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] may see their luck tested , meanwhile , as they see the Pistons on Tuesday . Detroit is fresh off a blowout of the league - best Golden_State Warriors .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) took down the shorthanded var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) for the second straight night on Thursday , winning var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . Though not mathematically eliminated , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain squarely out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture . However , the team has now won two straight after a back - to - back against the ailing var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . All-Star var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , also pulling down var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . Rookie var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also had a big night , notching a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double . The Latvian big man also swatted three shots en route to the win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have been grappling with major injuries for months , and Thursday was no exception . Key players var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] both sat , allowing big man var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] to slide into the starting lineup despite his average of just 7 minutes per game on the season . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] recorded a paltry var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists on the night , and the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bench combined for just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] in the contest . Despite these shortcomings , former MVP var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did shine with a big var_player[1][4][PTS] - point scoring night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] now sit 2 games behind the Pistons in the Eastern Conference playoff race . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Orlando to take on the Magic .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Tuesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) , who used a big fourth quarter to pull away from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Tuesday , are now winners of four of their last five games and look to be trending in the right direction with the return of their point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who played in his second game of the season since returning from a knee injury . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , however , was again placed on a minutes restriction , playing just var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes , but he still managed to record var_player[0][4][AST] points and var_player[0][4][PTS] assists in the outing . It was var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] who led the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , recording a game - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points on top of var_player[0][0][DREB] assists in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a double - double of var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in just var_player[0][2][FT_PCT] minutes . As a team , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't have a great night from the field , shooting just 45 percent , but they did play very efficient basketball , as they dished out var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists to just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] total turnovers . For var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , they continue to reel , as they have now lost three in a row and four of their last five games . Despite that , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] continues to have a breakout offensive season , as he posted var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes Tuesday and has now scored at least 26 points in var_player[1][0][FG3A] straight games to start the month of December . Beyond var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points , there were n't any other admirable performances against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as the rest of the starters combined to score just 29 points , while the bench managed to produce a measly var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] points . As a team , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] made just two of their var_team[1][TEAM-AST] 3 - point attempts and recorded just var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists to their var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Charlotte on Wednesday to take on the Hornets , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to turn things around Thursday at home against the San_Antonio Spurs , who remain a perfect 120 on the road .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is in the midst of a six - game road trip . After dropping the first game of the trip 120 - 107 to the Los_Angeles Clippers , they 've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never - weres of the Eastern Conference . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Friday . He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench . They 'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has lost var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] straight games to start the season . While that 's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation , it 's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] started at shooting guard next to var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] on Friday , an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season , and it 's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick . K.J . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] scored a career - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes , and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments . The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New_York to face the Knicks .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] Monday at AmericanAirlines Arena . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) continued to surge with heir fourth win in their last five games . They were led by point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who , despite having a poor shooting performance from the field , managed to record var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] steals in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] minutes , and his work has a floor leader propelled the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to have 46 assists to just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers as a team . Fellow starters on the wing var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[1][3][PTS] and var_player[1][0][PTS] points respectively , but it was the play of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's bench that really helped get them to victory , with var_player[1][0][REB] reserves managing to score 38 points Monday night . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , they came into Monday 's game depleted with injuries , with Dion_Waiters ( groin ) , var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] ( mouth ) and var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( wrist ) all ruled out . Additionally , starting point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( elbow ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( knee ) were both listed as questionable but managed to play through their ailments . And they were very impressive despite the injuries , with var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] posting var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] posting his own double - double of var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FTA] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting and var_player[0][4][AST] rebounds . Their efforts , however , were not nearly enough , as the team lacked much of an offensive punch outside of those two . They mainly lacked punch from the outside , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just 6 - of - 30 from behind the arc as a team . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to keep rolling at home Wednesday against the Pistons , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will head to Denver on Wednesday and play the Nuggets .
var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had an surprisingly hot start to the regular season in his first year with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as he became var_player[0][3][FTA] of the primary scoring options on a struggling var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] team , but a groin injury in late November derailed the former Syracuse star and left him sidelined for a little over a month . Following his return on Jan. var_player[0][3][DREB] , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] found the floor inconsistently as he worked his way back into basketball shape . But now , var_player[0][3][FG3A] games later , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] ' efficiency and production has been out of this world . Following his var_player[0][3][MIN] - point heroic performance against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Monday , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] has now , in each of his last two games , scored var_player[0][3][MIN] points in var_player[0][3][PTS] minutes , and he has done so at a ridiculous efficiency . In those two performances , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] has shot 25 - of - 39 ( 64 percent ) from the field and 11 - of - 16 ( 69 percent ) from behind the arc . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as winners of var_player[0][3][DREB] straight , is hot , and var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] is the biggest reason why .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) finally earned a win against the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Friday , winning var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . Third year center var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who have had a major slide and now hold the third - worst record in the NBA . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][1][FG3A] of his strongest outings of 2015 - 16 . Rookie var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , followed up a 34 - point outing on Thursday with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FGM] rebounds , and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . The 19 - year - old has established himself as a premier rookie and an elite three - point shooter already , early in his stint in the NBA . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] earned their win in emphatic fashion , holding the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and out - rebounding the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , remain firmly out of the playoff picture , particularly after losing to the NBA 's coldest team . Sophomore var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points while dishing var_player[0][4][AST] dimes . The rising star has been hot and cold lately , but continually shows flashes of star potential . Another prospect , rookie var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] followed up a career - high on Wednesday with an efficient var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds on Friday . The Croatian teenager was selected with the fifth pick in the 2015 draft . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Memphis on Sunday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will take on the league - best Warriors in Oakland on Monday .
var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] continues to be the lone bright spot for the var_player[1][2][AST] - win var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and is putting up terrific numbers during his 24 - minute restriction through var_player[1][2][REB] games . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][2][FGM] turnovers should not be of much concern , given his ability to grab var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds and var_player[1][2][PTS] points in just var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes of action , on top of his var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][REB] shooting . The efficiency down low , defensive prowess ( var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][2][FG3A] blocks and a steal ) , in addition to his three point shooting ability , make the Kansas product a matchup nightmare for every power forward or center in the league . The foot does not look to be of any concern so far , and head coach Brett var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] has claimed that the young star could see a minutes increase around Christmas . Seems like a great gift for the potential rookie of the year .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday at Time Warner Cable Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Both teams struggled with their shooting in this one . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went only var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . Neither team could really get in a groove , as both failed to reach the 100 - point mark . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to force var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] into 15 turnovers , which ultimately may have been the difference . With LeBron_James out for the next couple of weeks , as expected var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] took over the majority of the offensive production . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] led all scorers , as he went var_player[1][1][FGM] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][1][PF] - for - var_player[1][1][FG3A] from the three - point line to finish with var_player[1][1][PTS] points . After struggling to only seven points on Tuesday , it was good to see him bounce back with an outstanding performance Friday . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did n't have his most efficient day , but ended up scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][BLK] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) in 41 minutes . Over his last five games he 's averaged 27 points , so expect him to continue to get of plenty of shots as his confidence level is through the roof . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] had a solid contribution off the bench , as he finished with var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds . He had 17 of the 24 total bench points for the Cavs . The only other player to reach double figures was var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] . He recorded a double - double , as he had 14 points and 14 rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] top scorer was var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the floor to score var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . He 's combined for 49 points over his last three games , as he 's stepped up his scoring output during the past week . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was able to add a double - double of his own . He had 12 points and 10 rebounds , giving him his third double - double of the season . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] seemed to struggle with his shot . He went only 4 - for - 16 from the field and 1 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score 10 points . Coming off the bench , both var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] reach double - digit points with var_player[0][5][PTS] and var_player[0][7][PTS] points respectively . As a team though , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] just did n't have enough offensive production to get them a victory . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Orlando to play the Magic on Saturday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) dismantled the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to the tune of a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] scoreline on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took care of this game early and never allowed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to fight their way back in it . In fact , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was up var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] - 18 in the first 15 minutes and took a 25 - point lead into the half . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot over 50 percent from the field in the first half and amazingly did not commit a turnover until 28 minutes into the game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to under var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting in the win as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been playing horrible defense since var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] got injured , but they were great here . They held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starters to just 31 points in the win and allowed just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in the opening quarter . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] carried the load once again . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] tallied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists in the victory . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] boards to fall just shy of his fourth - straight double - double . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had allowed an average over 110 points per game without var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] in the lineup , so this defensive performance is a great sign going forward . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have a much tougher test in their next game , when they host the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Friday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were stifled in this game and really did n't muster up anything until it was too late . No player scored more than 12 points and that 's simply a bad recipe to win a game . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][FTM] rebounds . Phenom rookie var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][1][OREB] of his worst games of his short career , as he could only provide var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds on var_player[1][1][FGM] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting . This is just one of those game for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and they can just chalk it up to playing in a tough environment against a stifling defense . They 'll look to bounce - back when they take on the Sacramento Kings on Thursday in the second half of a back - to - back set
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) outgunned the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) in a high - scoring affair Friday , winning var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have had their share of struggles in recent weeks , but have maintained their stellar home record . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] checked in to Saturday with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] victories in 27 tilts at Quicken Loans Arena , and with an injury - hampered var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] ) squad on tap , they went into the game as heavy favorites . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] insured that they did n't squander the opportunity , leading the way with matching var_player[0][0][PTS] - point efforts . The Cavs were excellent on both ends of the floor , posting success rates of 55 percent from the field and 50 percent from three - point range , while limiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to respective tallies of var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] and 34 in those categories . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up as usual for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , pacing them with a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][2][AST] assists and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FG3M] rebounds , a steal and a block . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] ' scoring total while leading the second unit , and he added an assist and a steal . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] drew another start for Danilo_Gallinari ( groin ) and provided var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][FGM] boards and an assist . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] filled out the stat sheet with var_player[1][4][FGA] points , var_player[1][4][AST] rebounds , var_player[1][4][REB] assists and var_player[1][4][FG3M] steals . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was productive as a reserve as well with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][FTA] assists , var_player[1][5][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][5][OREB] steal . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] supplemented his aforementioned scoring total with var_player[0][4][FG3M] assists , var_player[0][4][PF] rebounds , var_player[0][4][OREB] steal and var_player[0][4][STL] block . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] dished out var_player[0][0][AST] assists , hauled in var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds and recorded a pair of steals . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a near double - double with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists and one block . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] supplied a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included an assist , a steal and a block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds , an assist and a steal .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got off to a hot start Monday , outscoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] in the first quarter . The lead only grew from there , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] outscored var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] in each of the var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ensuing quarters . Rebounding played a major role in the win for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as they established an var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 45 edge on the glass . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's rebounding advantage showed the same dominance on the glass that the team exhibited in its 55 - rebound season opener against the Boston Celtics . Scoring was no problem , either , for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Monday , as seven players recorded double digits in the points column . All-Star var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] lead the team with var_player[1][0][PTS] . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , scoring the ball did not prove quite as easy . The team hit just 34 percent of its shots from the floor , including a lackluster 16 percent from beyond the arc . Guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a team - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points and was var_player[0][3][AST] of only var_player[0][3][FG3A] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to score in double figures . he var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also saw a significant disadvantage in terms of ball movement , evidenced by the team 's measly var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists on the night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , recorded var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists , accounting for var_team[1][TEAM-REB] percent of their made field goals on the night . Both teams will take the floor again on Wednesday , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] taking on the Celtics and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hosting the Detroit Pistons .
The visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took down the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Sunday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has now won eight of its last nine games . On Sunday , the convincing win was due in large part to strong play from All-Star point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists while at the helm of the strong var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] offense . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to stave off a comeback attempt from var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] early in the second half with a strong fourth quarter . All five var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starters scored in double figures , and the starting five accounted for 96 of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's points . The team finished shooting over 50 percent from the field with ten three - pointers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has had a bumpy season thus far , trading off wins and losses fairly consistently after a rough 1 - 9 start . On Sunday , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were the var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] show , as the superstar led the team with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] rebounds . Three steals and two blocks rounded out what was a typically monstrous night for the 23 - year - old big man . Bench struggles were a problem for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Sunday , as the second unit shot only 36 percent on the night . Overall , the Pels ' var_team[1][TEAM-REB] percent shooting was not enough to overcome a very strong night for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on the offensive end . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will visit Toronto on Tuesday , while var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will host the Knicks on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( 30 ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , Thursday at the TD Garden to take a 30 lead in their series . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] looked to change its fortunes in Game var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] on its home court after dropping the first two games of the series in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hung close throughout the game and when var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who had his best game of the series , hit a var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] to cut the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' lead to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] with 2:45 remaining , it looked as though tide was turning in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's favor . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] extinguished that momentum almost immediately as var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] drained a corner var_player[1][1][AST] on the next possession to put the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] back up by var_player[1][1][FG3M] . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had his best game of the postseason with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , including var_player[1][1][OREB] big - time three pointers in the fourth quarter . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to avoid the sweep on Sunday when it hosts var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for Game 4 . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] not only had a big night from var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , but also a classic playoff performance from var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] . The superstar var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds , var_player[1][0][STL] steals , and var_player[1][0][BLK] blocks to lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . One of the unsung heroes for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was reserve forward var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who had var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds over var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][5][PF] offensive rebounds allowed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to retain possession at key moments down the stretch to let the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to run out the clock . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to finish out the series Sunday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's ability to hang close with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was made all the more impressive by the fact that it 's best scorer , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , was a non - factor for most of the game . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] , who had scored var_player[0][6][FG_PCT] points in each of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's first var_player[0][6][AST] games of the postseason , was held to just var_player[0][6][PTS] points on var_player[0][6][FGM] - of - var_player[0][6][FGA] shooting . To offset var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] ' quiet night off the bench , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] made a lot of noise in his var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes on the floor . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] was all over the court , forcing jump balls , nabbing var_player[0][7][STL] steals , and blocking var_player[0][7][FTM] shots to go with var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][7][PTS] points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will need a similar performance from var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] in Game var_player[0][7][FTM] , as well as a bigger outing from var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] , in order to extend the series on Sunday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at FedEx Forum on Friday . This appeared to be a lopsided matchup on paper , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] pulled out the shocking road win . They really controlled the game from start to finish , as they led for the final 45 minutes and never trailed by more than two points . Both teams really struggled offensively , as they each shot below 39 percent from the field . Fastbreak points were the only big advantage for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they won that battle , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - 9 . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] actually dominated many stats , as they took the advantage in rebounds , assists , steals and blocks in their defeat . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) played this game without Rudy_Gay ( hip ) , but they still pulled out an unlikely road win . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] struggled all night , as he went var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field and fouled out in the fourth quarter . With that said , he still led the team with 22 points and nine rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the hero , as he tallied var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks in his best game of the season . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] got the start for Gay and finished with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FGM] assists in a great fill - in performance . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other King in double figures , as he accrued var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to build off this win on Sunday in a road matchup with the Dallas Mavericks . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came into this game 90 in games decided by four points or less and they could n't quite comeback here to improve on that number . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( back ) made his return from a var_player[0][4][REB] - week absence to provide var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in 28 minutes . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , as he dropped var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][2][FG3A] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other starter in double figures , as he accumulated var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][TO] steals in the defeat . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] also scored at least var_player[0][6][PTS] points apiece off the bench . On deck for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is a home matchup against the Utah Jazz on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at United Center on Thursday evening . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) knew that they 'd have a massive challenge on their hands in trying to make up for the extended absence of Kevin_Durant ( knee ) , but also had to have a certain measure of confidence knowing that the Splash Bros. tandem that had been vastly successful before Durant 's arrival were ready to chuck away . That strategy fell woefully short Thursday , not necessarily in the margin of defeat , but rather , in overall offensive efficiency . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot an atypical var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor , including an unsightly var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ( 6 - for - 30 ) from behind the arc . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] were particularly aggressive as expected , yet managed to drain only 15 of their combined 49 shot attempts . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) also won the battle down low , outrebounding the visitors by a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 41 margin . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][STL] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was a distant second , netting only var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][PF] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) along with var_player[1][3][PF] rebound and var_player[1][3][PF] assist . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , another player expected to help pick up the slack in Durant 's stead , posted var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][DREB] assists , var_player[1][1][FG3M] blocks and var_player[1][1][OREB] steal . Rookie var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , starting at small forward , tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][DREB] boards , var_player[1][0][STL] assists , var_player[1][0][FTA] steals and var_player[1][0][PF] block . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][FTM] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FGM] assists , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][STL] steals and var_player[0][0][BLK] block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] managed a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[0][1][PF] block . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][3][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][3][PF] steals . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][DREB] block . The returning var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][10][PTS] points , var_player[0][10][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][10][FG3M] assist and var_player[0][10][STL] steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head to the Big Apple to take on the New_York Knicks on Sunday afternoon , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home for a Saturday night showdown with the Los_Angeles Clippers .

Their bench totaled 63 points , and they elicited var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] overall . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] ' var_player[1][9][PTS] points in var_player[1][9][MIN] minutes paced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was next , leading the starters with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had matching var_player[1][0][PTS] - point efforts . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][FGA] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][8][FG3A] rebounds ) was minimally involved , but var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][8][PTS] points ) and rookie var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][7][PTS] points ) were productive as reserves as well . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , while var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] turned in matching var_player[0][1][PTS] - point efforts . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][6][PTS] points ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][5][DREB] points ) followed , and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] hauled in var_player[0][5][REB] boards off the bench .
While the start of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' season has been pretty standard with a var_player[1][5][FG3A] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] start , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] 's play has been anything but . With his var_player[1][5][PTS] - point performance on Monday , var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] notched var_player[1][5][PTS] points for the second time in var_player[1][5][FG3M] games and at least 17 points for the third straight game . While var_player[1][0][FIRST_NAME] Parson 's return from a knee injury was expected to lead to a much - reduced role for var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] , it 's done the exact opposite , as with Parson 's struggling as he still works to make his way back to the floor , var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] has excelled and outscored var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] in each of the past var_player[1][5][FG3M] games . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] 's 9 points per game would be his highest average since the 2013 - 14 season . For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , they received an unexpected var_player[0][3][PTS] - point performance from var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] on Monday - - a performance that kept the team in the game with var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] struggling to get anything going . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had n't scored in double figures all season until Monday , and with var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] potentially out , the team could look to var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] to provide some added scoring on a more consistent basis when they 're a man down .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) showed the up and coming var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) who is boss , with a definitive var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] victory on Monday night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had control most of the way as they held the lead from the beginning of the second quater until the final whistle .

He is likely to be the man if var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] misses extended time . D.J . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] had played well in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_player[1][4][DREB] games prior to Wednesday , averaging var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points and 13 assists in those winning efforts .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has won 10 of their last 11 games . They rested var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] , who suffered a mild hamstring injury in Friday 's win over the Memphis Grizzlies , and var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( rest ) for this game . While coach Gregg Popovich planned to have var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] sit out as well , the Big Fundamental insisted on playing , and he put up var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][FGM] assists in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] filled in as the starter at point guard and led the way for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , putting up var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] assists in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game is on the road against the Utah Jazz on Tuesday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost five straight , and the injury bug continues to infect them . Ricky_Rubio ( ankle ) , Kevin_Martin ( wrist ) and var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( wrist ) remain out in what seems like perpetuity , and var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] was held out of Friday and Saturday 's games with back spasms , leaving var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] as the only healthy point guard on the roster . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did his best to step up , finshing with the first double - double of his career ( var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] rebounds ) in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came into Thursday fairly desperate for a win , as they 'd dropped four of six games and had the Boston Celtics nipping at their heels , only two games behind for the top seed in the Eastern Conference . Despite being faced with essentially the toughest defense in the NBA in the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) and losing var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( knee tightness ) and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( shoulder ) within the game , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] overcame the tough odds to prevail on the strength of a var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][DREB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[0][0][AST] assists , var_player[0][0][FG3M] steals and var_player[0][3][PF] block . The Cavs also saw the return of var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( knee ) to the starting lineup after missing 13 games , which helped offset the aforementioned in - game exits . Defense was a key as well , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] committed var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers and shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long distance . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][2][AST] assist , var_player[1][2][STL] steals and var_player[1][2][TO] blocks . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][FTA] assists and var_player[1][0][PF] steal . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] turned in matching var_player[1][3][FGA] - point efforts , with the former adding var_player[1][3][AST] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][STL] steal , and the latter supplying var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][1][STL] steal . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a modest effort of var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FTM] rebounds , var_player[1][4][FTM] assists and var_player[1][4][FG3M] steal . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] followed var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][FTM] assists over var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes before departing . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds over var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes before his exit , and J.R. var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] , getting extra run due to var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's early shower , led the bench with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] boards and var_player[0][5][PF] steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head to the Windy City to take on the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are West Coast-bound for a Saturday evening showdown of their own with the Los_Angeles Clippers .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) secured their fourth win in var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] games in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] Saturday night , defeating the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . All-NBA center var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued a dominant string of performances , delivering var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds along with a substantial defensive output of var_player[1][1][BLK] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks . The volatile var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] was suspended for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' Thursday matchup against the Heat for a forearm punch to Hawks center Al_Horford . Aside from that absence , however , var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] has been on a tear since returning from an injured achilles , posting five double - doubles and logging var_player[1][1][PF] 35+ point games . While many predicted a reduced role for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] upon the return of backup var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , coach George Karl instead elected to trot the var_player[1][4][PF] guards out alongside var_player[1][3][AST] another in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , who has been averaging an NBA-leading 10 assists per game , saw a team - high var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . It seems that Karl is committed to keeping the veteran point guard a major part of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' rotations . The story of the night for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , was inconsistency behind the arc . The team shot just 29 percent from behind the three - point line , including var_player[0][0][AST] - for - var_player[0][0][FG3A] from shooting guard var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will hope to get back on track as they prepare for a difficult matchup against the conference - leading Cavs in Cleveland . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , on the other hand , has been picking up steam of late , and will hope to carry this momentum into their matchup against Charlotte on Monday .
While this looks like a lopsided win for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , it took a late run to get there . In fact , neither team led by more than 12 points , as it took a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - 20 , fourth quarter for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to win . The turnovers were the difference , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] committing 16 turnovers to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also took advantage of scoring in transition and through the paint , winning the points in the paint and fastbreak point differentials , 70 - 36 . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists on var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] accrued var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the player of the game , collecting var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][1][DREB] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][AST] assists off the bench .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have largely suffered through a miserable 2015 - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] campaign so far , with Kobe_Bryant 's league - wide retirement tour and the positive vibes it 's generated serving as their primary source of pride and optimism . However , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has slowly begun showing signs of life in recent games , with their mix of young and veteran pieces starting to gel . With Sunday 's dominating victory , a game in which they led by as much as 30 at one point , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have now won a season - high three straight games . It 's their first such streak since last February , and while not a notable winning stretch for most other teams in the NBA , it could certainly be an indicator of a progressively improving squad . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] continues to struggle on offense without Eric_Bledsoe , who is out for the season after knee surgery . Backcourt mate var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] is certainly doing his best to hold down the fort , and led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring Sunday with var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . It was his second consecutive 20 - point - plus effort , and he 's now put up a robust 62 shot attempts over the last three games , a tangible indicator of the offensive responsibility the five - year pro is shouldering . Unfortunately for both var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , Bledsoe 's replacement , rookie var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , was the only other starter who posted double - digit scoring , managing var_player[1][3][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds , an assist and a steal . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with var_player[1][9][PTS] points , var_player[1][9][REB] rebounds and an assist , his third straight game with double - digit points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][1][FG3A] points ) , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][DREB] points ) and P.J . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[1][0][DREB] points ) led a parade of underwhelming offensive efforts for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who also were hampered by a shockingly scoreless outing from T.J. var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] over var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and continues in fourth place in the Westen Conference 's Pacific Division . They head home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday . The home team was spearheaded by an explosive performance from var_player[0][3][FTM] - guard Louis var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , who collected a season - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points and also equaled a season best by hauling in var_player[0][3][FG3A] rebounds . The veteran drained a season - best six three - pointers as well , managing his best shooting night from long range on the season ( 86 percent ) . var_player[0][1][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] , Jr. posted an impressive double - double in support of var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] ' effort , posting var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] boards . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] points ) and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][PTS] points ) were the other starters to also reach double - digit scoring , and the pair also stuffed the stat sheet in other categories . The former added six rebounds , three assists and three blocks , while the latter supplemented his points with seven assists , five rebounds , three steals and a block . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] bench with an var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - point outing . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] but remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They 'll be home again on Tuesday for a date with the reigning NBA champion Golden_State Warriors .
var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] are in desperate need of a winning streak and this dominant result is a good start to that run . They got out to a 27 - 17 lead after the first quarter in what was nearly a wire - to - wire win . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot very efficiently , as they hit var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their shots in the victory . They held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range on their end . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starters in scoring , as he totaled var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points and var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double off the bench , accruing var_player[1][6][FGA] points and var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was third on the team , as he dropped var_player[1][7][PTS] points off the bench . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the player of the game , as he collected var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] accumulated var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][PF] assists in just 30 minutes of action .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] learned before the game that var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] would miss the contest with an illness , setting the stage for additional offensive responsibility for offseason acquisition var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] . The veteran shooting guard resoundingly answered the bell , posting a season - high and game - high 31 points on an outstanding 13 - of - 19 shooting performance . Six of those points came in the extra period , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] pulled even with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] at var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] before var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to pull away . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's effort was part of a remarkable var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting night for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , which notably accomplished the feat in var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] 's absence . The stellar accuracy rate from the field also was considerably better than the victorious var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent figure . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] supported var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's stellar performance with a huge double - double that consisted of var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , along with an assist , a steal and a pair of blocks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also turned in a solid game in a spot start in var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] 's stead , amassing var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . However , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists and a steal ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( scoreless over var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , with var_player[0][2][PF] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and a block ) could not do much to support var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's offensive cause . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' bench with a var_player[0][5][PTS] - point , var_player[0][5][DREB] - rebound outing , his second consecutive double - digit scoring game . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] also represented the reserves well , managing var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][FGM] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They next face the Sixers in a home tilt on Wednesday .

He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points , while also recording eight assists .

Tuesday 's game was the second half of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] `` home - and - home `` set that started Sunday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] routed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 106 - var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] in that game , but Tuesday 's game proved to be far more competitive . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hung close throughout Tuesday 's contest thanks to rookie var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] point , var_player[1][4][FTA] assist outing , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' timely shooting helped seal their seventh straight victory over their cross - town rival .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will play the second half of a back - to - back set Wednesday when they travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] could ill - afford to drop a winnable game Tuesday after the Spurs tied their record with a blowout win over the Thunder .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the Staples Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . It was another nice victory for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who have now extended their winning streak to three straight games . They 're already locked in as the seventh seed in the Western Conference standings , so they 'll look to continue to build their momentum with the playoffs on the verge of beginning . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been eliminated from the playoffs for quite some time now , but the loss only helps their cause , as a worse record increases the potential for a higher landing spot for the 2015 NBA Draft . With the fourth worst record in the league , it 's almost a sure thing they 'll get a very high pick come draft day . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . It was var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] who surprisingly led the team in scoring . He went 9 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 20 points , while also adding nine rebounds and two blocked shots . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were just too young and inexperienced in their frontcourt , as var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] was able to have a field day . It was just the fourth time all season that he reached the 20 - point mark , so it was easily one of his best offensive performances of the year . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] also gave a solid contribution . In 27 minutes as a starter , he finished with 17 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 7 - 9 FT ) and three rebounds . He 's shot very well over his last two games and has combined for 41 points during that span , so he 'll look to keep his confidence high going into the playoffs . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the third starter in double figures , as he recorded var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][TO] - var_player[1][1][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][1][FTM] rebounds . He 's now averaging 19 points over his last seven games . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][8][PTS] points ( var_player[1][8][FGM] - var_player[1][8][FGA] FG , var_player[1][8][FG3M] - var_player[1][8][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][8][AST] - var_player[1][9][PF] FT ) and var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][9][PTS] points ( var_player[1][9][FGM] - var_player[1][9][FGA] FG , var_player[1][8][BLK] - var_player[1][9][PF] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][9][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] production was very spread out through their lineup Sunday , with seven players reaching double - digit points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way , finishing with a game - high of var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][AST] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . The rookie has been a very nice surprise for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] so far this season , as he 's averaged var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] points and 8 assists over his last four games . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] received some help from var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] though . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][0][FGM] - for - var_player[0][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][0][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][0][FG3A] from the three - point line to score an efficient var_player[0][0][PTS] points over var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . He had shot below 40 percent from the field in four out of his last five games coming into Sunday , so it was good to see him finally have some better success in this one . While it was n't his best game shooting the ball , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] still posted var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][PF] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][3][DREB] assists over var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . He 's combined for var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] points and nine assists over his last two games , moving his season averages to 10 points and 2 assists over 17 games with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Monday , while the Kings will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - 32 ) , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , on Sunday at the Verizon Center . Sunday 's earliest game got off to a sluggish start , especially for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . For much of the game , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] appeared to be the only Wizard that was playing at full speed . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] started to let its lead slip away during the fourth quarter when var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] canned a var_player[0][10][OREB] to cut it to var_player[0][10][FGM] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] answered with consecutive three pointers to extend the lead back to double digits . Every time the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] would start to embark on a comeback , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had an answer . The `` Hack a var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] `` strategy backfired for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] as var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] hit var_player[1][2][FTM] of his var_player[1][2][FTA] free throw attempts . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a chance to cut var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's lead to var_player[0][3][TO] late in the game , but had his shot rejected by var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , which all but sealed it for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has now won four in a row , three of which have come on the road . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are the third - best road team in the league , behind only the Hawks and Warriors with a var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - 13 mark away from the Toyota Center .

While veteran var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] has generally done a solid job in Beal 's stead , he has considerably cooled off since a var_player[0][3][AST] - game stretch in mid - to - late December where he tallied over 20 points in each contest .

Considering how close this game was , it was strange how the lead was split . In fact , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] led for less than four minutes of this game and the two teams were within six points for nearly the entirety of the fourth quarter . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench was the only thing keeping it close , as they outscored the starters 64 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . Six bench players played at least var_team[1][TEAM-AST] minutes for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , with no starter playing more than var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] minutes .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) continued their ridiculous hot streak on Tuesday , beating the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at Madison Square Garden . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has now won 13 of its last 15 games . Despite most preseason projections placing the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] squarely in the lottery , the surprising young team has emerged as the sixth - place team in the Western Conference with a real chance to make it to fifth by the season 's end . Much of the credit for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's meteoric rise must be given to point guard var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , of course , whose averages of var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] assists per game helped var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to the league 's second - best record in the month of February . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] took the reigns once again on Tuesday , pouring in var_player[1][3][PTS] points including a perfect var_player[1][3][FTA] - for - var_player[1][3][FTA] from the line . Guard C.J . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was also an integral piece , as he exploded for var_player[1][4][PTS] points . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has emerged as var_player[1][4][PF] of the league 's biggest breakout stars this season , making var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_player[1][4][PF] of just var_player[1][4][DREB] teams in the association with multiple guards averaging over 20 points per game . No other var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starter notched more than four points , but it did n't seem to matter , as the dynamic duo 's var_team[1][TEAM-REB] combined points were enough to bury the struggling var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , poor shooting was the story of the night . The team posted splits of just 38/29/72 in what was a truly abysmal night from the field . While perennial All-Star var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored a team - leading var_player[0][0][PTS] points , no other Knick eclipsed 13 on the night , and only var_player[0][0][AST] scored in double - digits .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] sagged off of var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] all night , and he made them pay with a barrage of mid - range jumpers . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] did n't want to let var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] get all the glory . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] abused the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] both inside the paint and beyond the arc , scoring a game - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points to go with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . New coach Lionel Hollins is letting his verterans play this season , an idea that seemed out of the question for ex - coach Jason Kidd last season . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] continues to be a great source of long - range shooting and rebounding off the bench for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . He finished with 12 points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was confined to var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes due to foul trouble , but the return of var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] to the active lineup helped soften the blow of var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] spending much of the game on the bench . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] was suspended for the first two games of the season , but in his regular season debut Saturday , he put up a double - double of var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] each played over var_player[0][1][FG_PCT] minutes but had shooting woes throughout the game . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] finished var_player[0][3][PF] - of - var_player[0][1][FTA] from the free - throw line , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] missed all var_player[0][1][FGM] of his heaves from beyond the arc . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who lost significant minutes to backup D.J . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] in the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' first var_player[0][7][FG3A] games , was a revelation in the first half of the game and finished with 18 points and nine assists in 36 minutes .

He 's only reached the 20 - point mark twice this season , but he seems to be continuing to gain confidence as the season goes on . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] backcourt of var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] were the other var_player[1][4][FG3M] who really helped the team fight off the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][REB] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FTA] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FGM] assists , while var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][AST] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][REB] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][3][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists .

The Hawks still own a 10 and a half game lead for the top overall spot , so it remains unlikely the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] can make up that gap in time for the playoffs . This marks a tough loss for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as it pushes them to three games behind the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the East . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot really well in this game , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while having seven players reach double figures in points . J.R. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][2][MIN] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][REB] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][2][FTM] rebounds in just 16 minutes , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][2][MIN] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTA] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][3][AST] assists over var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] has picked his game up of late and is averaging 13 points and 4 rebounds over his last var_player[0][2][FTA] games . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] also got into the action and finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][8][FIRST_NAME] had scored over 20 points in each of his last var_player[0][0][FG3A] games , but he did n't need to Wednesday , as everyone seemed to play well offensively and put up some points . Both var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with double - doubles . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][AST] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FG3M] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FG3A] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][4][AST] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][1][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][PF] - var_player[0][1][TO] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . Despite suffering the loss , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] posted a solid all - around game . In 28 minutes , he scored a team - high of 20 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) , while also adding six assists and two rebounds . He 's been pretty inconsistent lately , but is averaging 10 points , 3 rebounds , 5 assists and 1 steals over his last five games . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also saw some solid contributions from their bench . Center var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] went a perfect var_player[1][7][FGA] - for - var_player[1][7][FGM] from the field , while going just var_player[1][7][FTM] - for - var_player[1][7][FTA] from the free throw line to score var_player[1][7][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds in just var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . He has n't produced much offensively since losing a large portion of his playing time to var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , as this was just the first time in his last six games that he reached double figures in points . Both var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] played well off the bench and finished with var_player[1][5][PTS] and var_player[1][6][PTS] points respectively . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday .
The visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] destroyed the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Wednesday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) earned its fourth straight victory in style on Wednesday , eviscerating the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in one of their most convincing wins of the season . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] outscored the Pels in every quarter and seemingly could do no wrong all night . They finished shooting over 54 percent with 14 three - pointers , 25 assists , and a 48 - 37 advantage in rebounding . One key difference - maker was the strength of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's bench . Veteran var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring with var_player[1][8][PTS] points off the bench , while var_player[1][8][DREB] other members of the second unit scored in double figures . It was a strong night for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's starters as well , including center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] played stellar defense on var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] superstar var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , and also pulled down a team - high var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , meanwhile , has now lost five of its last six games . Despite a strong defensive night in which he blocked var_player[0][2][BLK] shots , star big man var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a lackluster performance on the offensive end , shooting just var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] for only var_player[0][2][FGA] points . One of the main struggles for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was hitting shots from long - range , as the team shot only 5 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] from beyond the arc . Ball movement was also an issue , as the team posted only 17 assists on the night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit Dallas to play the Mavericks on Thursday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will travel to Minnesota to battle the Timberwolves on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . Although their postseason hopes have long been crushed , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took on the third - seeded var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] as if they had something to play for . var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] coach George Karl opted to give var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] another night off to rest , bringing var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] into the starting lineup . The veteran guard responded well to the starting opportunity , tallying the team 's highest point total . The high - scoring , back - and - forth affair came down to the final seconds , as var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was able to sink var_player[1][1][FG3M] free throws after a var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] foul with less than a second remaining . On the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's last - gasp possession , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who committed a game - high var_player[1][4][TO] turnovers , missed a desperation 52 - foot three - point heave that would have sent the game into overtime . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][0][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was next with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][PF] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] managed var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FG3M] steals . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds and a steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remains atop the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and are in the third seed in the conference as well . They 're home against the Los_Angeles Lakers on Monday night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was paced by var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] was next with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][AST] assists , var_player[0][0][PF] steals and var_player[0][0][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a quiet night by his standards , supplying var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][1][OREB] assists , var_player[0][1][STL] steals and a block . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][AST] assists and var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are currently in third place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Monday night .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) cruised to an var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] victory over the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] sorely missed var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] once again as they did n't have a single player score more than 15 points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes of action . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] scored their seventh win against Western Conference competition Wednesday and enters the All-Star break in decent position in the Eastern Conference playoff race .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took a six - point lead into halftime and led var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - 92 with 5:47 to play . It looked like they were going to coast to a victory until the final minute , when a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] lost ball turnover followed by a var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - second violation opened the door for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , who closed it to 106 - 105 with 20 seconds to go . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a chance to tie it in the game 's final second , but var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] blocked the layup attempt and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's unlikely comeback bid fell just short . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] hit var_player[1][5][FG3M] of his var_player[1][5][FG3A] three - point attempts as he came off the bench to lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FTM] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] FT ) . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][FGA] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG ) and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][TO] - var_player[1][1][FG3A] 3PT , var_player[1][4][DREB] - var_player[1][4][REB] FT ) led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starters with var_player[1][4][PTS] points apiece , and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] notched a double - double with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] managed to shoot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor despite missing var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( left abductor strain ) and var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( stomach virus ) from the lineup . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3PT , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) led all scorers , and he filled up the box score with var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][3][PTS] and added var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds . The only other Raptor to reach double figures was var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] with var_player[0][8][PTS] , however , as the team as a whole failed to find its shot . They made just 45 percent of their shots from the floor and shot 6 - 20 ( 30 percent ) from beyond the arc . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue their road trip Wednesday against the Wizzards . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head on the road Tuesday to face the Bucks .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Thursday in Mexico City . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] outscored var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] in the first quarter and the game was never competitive after that . The frustration clearly boiled over for this var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team , as var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was ejected in the third quarter . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into this game as one of the best assisting teams in the NBA and that proved to be the difference , as they outassisted the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] also shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this game as the more well - rounded team with less talent and the teamwork prevailed yet again . While var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] were likely the var_player[0][4][DREB] best players on the floor , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are simply a better team . In fact , four players on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] scored at least 20 points and this was an all - around great team effort . It was a revenge game for var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and he was fantastic , tallying var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steals in the win . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] also had a nice game off the bench , as he collected var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][AST] rebounds and var_player[1][8][REB] assists in the victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will have a great test in their next game when they take on the San_Antonio Spurs on Saturday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had a rough night in Mexico City and they 'll be happy to get out of there . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was ejected in the third quarter for var_player[0][4][FGM] technical fouls and it was a bit of a surprise he was the only var_player[0][4][PF] with all the frustration the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] showed . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a lackluster game , as he tallied just var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][FGM] assists while battling foul trouble . The best player for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on this night was var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who contributed var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] rebounds in the loss . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce - back when they take on the Houston Rockets on Saturday in what should be a high - scoring bonanza .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) beat the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] thanks to some stifling second - half defense on Friday . These are two teams that are going in opposite directions right now and this result proves that fact . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] outplayed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in nearly every facet , as they outshot , outrebounded and outassisted the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . They held var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to just var_team[1][TEAM-REB] points in the second half and 37 percent shooting throughout the game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has had one of the worst offenses in the NBA this season and that certainly did n't improve on Friday . They had just 13 assists and made only 30 baskets in a dreadful game . Since moving var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] to the bench , things have only gotten worse in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and more moves may be on the horizon . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points scored and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] put in a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound effort . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to play better on Saturday , when they host the Indiana Pacers . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had a spark about them tonight and showed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] how tides are changing in the West . There were some fun moments , as var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] turned back the clock to dunk and record a block in this game . The team recorded an amazing 27 assists on 34 made baskets and that emphasizes how good their ball movement was tonight . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had yet another double - double , as he snatched var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in the win . The most encouraging sign here was the effort by var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who accumulated var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][DREB] assists in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes of play . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will have a few days off until they play the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday in their next fixture .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday night at the United Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are off to an impressive start to 2014 , and a large part of that has been due to a major team effort on the offensive end . While var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][PF] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got production from all over . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] both posted double - doubles , with var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] putting up var_player[0][1][FGA] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FG3A] - var_player[0][1][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][2][OREB] FT ) to go with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][FTA] assists , var_player[0][2][FTA] blocks and var_player[0][1][FTM] steal . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][2][FGA] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][PTS] FG , var_player[0][2][PF] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] look to keep their winning ways rolling as they head to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Thursday night . For the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , they just could n't dig themselves out of a first half hole , and have lost var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] in a row now . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] only played eight players in this game , and while seven of the eight scored at least nine points , no one scored more than var_team[1][TEAM-AST] . Both var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had double - double 's , with var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] collecting var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][PF] assists and var_player[1][0][TO] blocks . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG ) to go with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] now look to right the ship as they 'll head to Washington to take on the Wizards on Wednesday night .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) steamrolled the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] Trailblazers ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in the overtime period on Sunday , leading to a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] win . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] veteran var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the game with var_player[0][1][PTS] points . It was a new season high for the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] legend , whose var_player[0][1][PTS] points led play - by - play commentator Mark Followill to proclaim `` he still is and always will be var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] . `` The sixth - leading scorer of all time tacked on yet another big performance to a list of many , going 16 - for - 26 from the field with three three - pointers . The team as a whole shot a stunning 55 percent from the field including 15 - for - 25 from three - point territory . In addition to var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's vintage performance , point guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] boasted an impressive stat line of var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . The second unit kept things going for the Mavs , with center var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] dominating for var_player[0][10][PTS] points , var_player[0][10][REB] rebounds , and a whopping var_player[0][10][FGA] blocks . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's hopes for a higher seed will remain alive after Sunday 's contest , as the team remains in a tight race between the sixth , seventh , and eighth place teams in the West . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] also saw an impressive performance from a big man , as center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] pulled down a massive var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . The young Duke alum was simply unstoppable on the boards , pulling down 10 rebounds on the offensive end alone . The star backcourt of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] had a typical strong showing , scoring 26 and var_player[1][3][PTS] respectively . The team had a poor shooting night on the whole , however , going just 40 percent from the floor . The two teams will meet again on Wednesday in what should be an important matchup for the Western Conference playoff picture .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , in Game var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] of the Eastern Conference first - round playoffs on Saturday at Philips Arena . This was n't the prettiest game by any means , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held off a feisty var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bunch for a crucial Game var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot just 23 percent in a 34 - point first half and that ultimately built too deep of a hole to climb out of . The defense was key for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as they held var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] percent shooting from the field and stifled for the majority of the game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] did outscore var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 67 to 51 in the second half , but it simply was n't enough . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also took 35 free - throws compared to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] simply could n't stop fouling . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] played great in the second half , but a terrible first half held them back in this loss . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and also dished out var_player[1][4][AST] assists in the loss . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][3][PTS] points through var_player[1][3][REB] quarters , but had to leave early with what appeared to be a hamstring injury . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double in a var_player[1][0][PTS] - point , var_player[1][0][REB] - rebound outing . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] did n't play their best game , but they escaped with a narrow win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , while also snatching down var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was fantastic as well , accumulating var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][PF] rebounds in the win . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][0][STL] of his best games of the season , scoring var_player[0][0][PTS] points and grabbing var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . Game 2 will be on Tuesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] being a projected five - point favorite .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell behind by a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] margin after one quarter , but limited var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to just 65 points the rest of the way . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot a stellar var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent , although the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] countered with an impressive var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][0][PTS] points led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] managed a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][PTS] - rebound double - double . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][1][PTS] points , and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] turned in matching var_player[0][3][FGA] - point efforts . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with a pair of var_player[0][9][PTS] - point tallies . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] posted a game - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][0][PTS] , and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][2][FGA] . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][1][PTS] points despite a sore shoulder . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] notched a spot start for var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] ( foot ) and collected var_player[1][3][PTS] points , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][5][PTS] points led the bench .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , Thursday night at Talking Stick Resort Arena . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] represent two of the worst records in the NBA this season . With this result var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] suffered its 13th straight loss , tying a franchise - high . This loss also marked a franchise - high eighth - straight home loss for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Although they are far out of the playoff race , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have been playing slightly better as of late , winning four of their last eight games , after a horrible stretch during which they lost 15 of var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] waived Joe_Johnson early on Thursday , which gave some of their younger players a chance to showcase their skills in this contest and they did just that . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a career - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FTA] - var_player[1][6][PTS] FG , var_player[1][6][REB] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) , in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][PF] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FTM] - var_player[1][6][FTA] FT ) , along with var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][OREB] assist and var_player[1][6][STL] steal , in var_player[1][0][PTS] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] also stepped it up as he finished with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTA] - var_player[1][1][FTM] FT ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][STL] steals , var_player[1][1][BLK] assists and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocked shots , in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . Despite giving up 18 turnovers , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played well offensively , shooting var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long range and hitting var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - of - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] free throws . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] did not do a good job of controlling the ball and establishing rhythm as they gave up 21 turnovers and recorded only var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] assists on 42 made field goals . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] stood out as a bright spot for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as he tallied var_player[0][6][MIN] points ( var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][6][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][FG3M] - var_player[0][6][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][6][AST] - var_player[0][6][FTM] FT ) , along with var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds , in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][BLK] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][BLK] steals , var_player[0][2][AST] assist and var_player[0][2][AST] block , in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , after missing var_player[0][2][STL] games with a sore shoulder . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FTM] - var_player[0][5][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] 's status for this game was in question after he twisted his ankle in practice on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] battled back after entering the fourth down - 19 , to bring it as close as 10 , a difference their 13 missed free throws would have more than settled . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Grizzlies on Saturday , and will look to avoid setting a single - season , franchise - high 14th straight loss . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will move on to Utah to play the Jazz on Saturday , in what will be their third game of a nine - game road trip .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , to take a 20 series lead in the Western Conference semifinals Tuesday at Oracle Arena . Through var_player[0][3][REB] quarters , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] frustrated the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shooters and kept var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] in check . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was lights out in the third quarter and led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to a nine point lead heading into the final period , but a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] fourth quarter blowout progressed the home team to a commanding var_player[1][4][FGA] series lead . The depth of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] was on display , as var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] scored the first var_player[0][10][PTS] points of the fourth quarter , which helped narrow the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] lead . From there on out , it was the var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] show , as both players helped from behind the arc and inside the paint , while the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shooters went ice cold . With 55 seconds remaining in regulation , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] put back the dagger dunk to extend the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lead to var_player[0][5][FGA] points . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , and fell var_player[0][3][TO] three - pointers shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to drain var_player[0][3][FGM] - plus three - pointers in four consecutive games . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] marquee shooting guard added var_player[0][1][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][1][FTM] assists , while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] stuffed the stat sheet once again , and finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists , var_player[0][1][STL] steal and var_player[0][1][PF] blocks . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] played var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes in the absence of Stephen_Curry , and contributed var_player[0][4][PTS] points , including a sweet looking turnaround jumper later in the fourth quarter . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][AST] assists . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] almost single handedly carried the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in his impressive third quarter scoring spree , but the tight knit defense that was presented by var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] late in the game frustrated the point guard . The Weber var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] product and de facto leader of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points , four rebounds and six assists on 8 - of - 20 shooting . C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] bounced back after a quiet Game var_player[1][2][BLK] and added var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] var_player[1][2][FGA] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were inefficient from the free throw line , and the additional points that could have came from the charity stripe would have only extended the early lead they got off to . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] finished 14 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] from the stipe , as compared to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] nearly perfect 18 - of - 20 free throw shooting . Game 3 moves to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , and will take place on Saturday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . After coming out of the first quarter down by var_player[1][1][FTA] , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took off in the second behind var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_player[1][1][MIN] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] to take a nine - point lead into the half . While it looked as if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had all the momentum , it was instead all var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in the second half , as they finally got into a rhythm and took advantage of a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' team who was without Chris_Paul . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was a big reason the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finally turned things around in the second half . He finished with 32 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 3 - 10 3Pt ) , 16 of which came in the fourth quarter , while also adding three rebounds and seven assists . He did have seven turnovers though , so it was n't all good for the guard . While he hit only var_player[0][3][FG3_PCT] percent of his three - point shots , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] did what he does best and got to the free throw line . He went a perfect 15 - of - 15 from the line , helping the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shoot a whopping 64 free throws . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] did receive a ton of help from var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] though . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] went just var_player[0][2][FTM] - for - var_player[0][2][FTA] from the free throw line , but he still managed to score var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG ) in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][OREB] blocked shots as well , helping the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to secure a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 40 rebounding advantage , which also made a big difference . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point ( var_player[0][0][PF] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][0][REB] - rebound double - double as well . Right from the start , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] knew he 'd have to do the bulk of the work for this team with Chris_Paul still sidelined . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] recorded 14 points in the first quarter alone , and then went on to score a game - high of var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][OREB] - var_player[1][1][BLK] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , while also adding var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists . He was making jump shots , getting in the post , basically doing everything he wanted all night , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] just did n't play enough defense in the second half to come out successful . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] is averaging an impressive 25 points , var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FTM] assists over the first nine games of the playoffs , but he 'll welcome the return of Chris_Paul with open arms for game var_player[1][1][TO] . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] notched a double - double of his own , recording var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FTA] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FG , var_player[1][2][OREB] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FT ) , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocked shots . He 's now posted double - digit rebounds in eight of nine playoff games . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][6][PTS] points off the bench , but he shot just var_player[1][6][FGM] - for - var_player[1][6][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][6][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][6][FG3A] from the three - point line , as he seemed to struggle with his shot . These teams will now head to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for game three on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] continues to act as the best player on this var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team as of late , as Friday night he scored a game - high var_player[0][6][PTS] points on var_player[0][6][REB] - of - var_player[0][6][FGA] shooting , grabbed var_player[0][6][FG3A] rebounds and blocked var_player[0][6][FTM] shots in var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] minutes . Injuries have plagued var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , and it has been var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] 's play that has allowed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to continue winning regardless . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes and has also stepped up his game as of late , scoring 42 points in his last var_player[0][0][PF] outings . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was just two points shy of a triple - double , recording var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . Paul var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] put up var_player[0][4][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][REB] assists in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][4][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][1][FTA] assists in var_player[0][1][FG_PCT] minutes . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] returned to the rotation Friday after missing the previous 10 games with an ankle injury . He played only 10 minutes and scored six points . Jimmy_Butler ( elbow ) is practicing and is set to return soon , while Derrick_Rose ( knee ) remains out but is on schedule in his recovery . As a team , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot an impressive var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and the win pushes them ahead of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for third place in the Eastern Conference , and they stand 3 games behind the Cavaliers for second . var_player[1][3][FIRST_NAME] Derozan lead the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the losing effort , recording var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FTM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FG3M] assists in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . Unfortunately for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , the rest of the team was unable to contribute much more , as var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] served as the only other starter who scored in double figures , putting up var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] got the start after var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] was ruled out prior to the game with a back injury . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] scored a solid var_player[1][6][PTS] points on var_player[1][6][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][FGA] shooting in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes off the bench , but as a team , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot a poor var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . The loss moves them back into fourth place in the East , where they hold just a half - game lead over the Wizards for fifth . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Detroit Saturday to take on the Pistons , while var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will play the Knicks at home on Sunday .
var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] may not be as much of a highlight reel as compared to the rest of the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , but the Kentucky product is quietly taking his stats up a notch . Although it 's a small sample size of just seven games , var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] has improved across almost every statistical category from his 2015 - 2016 season where he played 81 games . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] forward is averaging 14 points , 8 rebounds and var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] assists per game while shooting 60 percent overall . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] continued the strong start with var_player[0][1][PTS] points on var_player[0][1][FTA] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting against the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the win on Sunday . The minutes management for the deep var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] squad could be the reasoning behind the shared success among the first seven games . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] saw var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes of action Sunday , while var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes ) and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes ) saw slightly more than the third - year forward . As for the bench , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] all saw more than var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes of action .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at AT & T Center on Saturday . It was mostly smooth sailing for the host var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they improved their impeccable home record on the season to 300 . If not for the Golden_State Warriors remarkable run at history , there would be more focus on how Gregg Popovich 's squad . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGA] shots , but rounded out the box score with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][6][FIRST_NAME] Ginobli proved to be the needed scoring asset off the bench , and turned back the clock with some vintage euro steps , as he scored var_player[0][6][PTS] points on a lights out var_player[0][6][FGM] - of - var_player[0][6][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] each pitched in double figures , and the well rounded team needed all the help they could get , as LaMarcus_Aldridge ( hamstring ) and Tim_Duncan ( rest ) did not play . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] depth is one of their biggest strengths , and proved too much to handle for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who failed to pull the game within striking distance after the second quarter . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will visit the Indiana Pacers ( 33 - 30 ) on Monday . Rebounding proved to be the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] major shortcoming in the game , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] dominated the glass var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] put forth another dominant effort and contributed var_player[1][2][PTS] points to lead all scorers , to go along with var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][FG3A] assists on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a go - to in the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] gameplan , and his var_player[1][1][PTS] points were above his season average , but when var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] does not get his shot going , especially in a volume effort , the lack of scoring options tends to make var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's battles an uphill task . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][5][PTS] points off the bench , in addition to var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][AST] assists on var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][5][FGA] shooting in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 23 - var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) on Monday .
var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was second in the NBA in usage rate headed into this game and he showed just why he 's so useful . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] dropped a career - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points in this win , doing that damage in just var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes of action . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] dominated down low all night , as they scored var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] paint points to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's 40 .

As a team , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot an impressive var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from behind the arc on a night where it seemed as if anything and everything was dropping for them .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) snatched victory from the jaws of defeat with a buzzer beater victory Wednesday against the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) at Pepsi Center , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] took a 98 - 97 lead on a var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] hook shot with 3:22 to go in the game . They still owned that lead when var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] stepped to the free throw line with var_player[1][6][FG3M] seconds to go and a var_player[1][6][BLK] - point lead . But var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] made just var_player[1][6][FTM] of the var_player[1][6][OREB] free throws to give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] an opening . Lacking a time out , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had to go the length of the floor , and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] sank a three - point shot from near midcourt at the buzzer to give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] the comeback victory . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's buzzer beater finished off var_player[0][4][PF] of the best games of his career , as he scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][DREB] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3PT , var_player[0][4][AST] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] FT ) , grabbed var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , dished var_player[0][4][AST] assists and committed just var_player[0][4][PF] turnover . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FTA] - var_player[0][3][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][REB] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) added var_player[0][3][PTS] points apiece . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] more than doubled var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's output from the free throw line , as they earned 40 free throws and sank 32 ( var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent ) . T.J.McConnell led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with 17 points ( 7 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] FG , 1 - 1 3PT , 2 - 2 FT ) and dished five assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][PF] - var_player[1][6][PF] FT ) and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FG3M] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] 3PT ) scored var_player[1][6][PTS] points apiece as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had five players reach double figures . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot an excellent 15 - 37 ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) from three - point land , but just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent on two - point shots , and they could n't capitalize on their deep sharpshooting as a result . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head for Los_Angeles to take on the Lakers on Friday night . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's road trip continues with a Saturday matchup against the Trail_Blazers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] stopped their two - game losing streak with the win . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points to go with var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . Six players scored in double figures for var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , including var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] who scored var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points in var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] minutes off the bench . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is slowly but surely learning how to play with a guard like var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , and it 's intriguing watching the pass - first point guard score more in the Mavs ' system . They 'll try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Sunday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] played their third straight game without var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] continues to sit out due to general soreness as a result of his 36 - year - old body having a lot of NBA miles on it . In two of the games var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] missed , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have been competitive while sharing the ball , causing some to question how much var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] has helped or hurt the team this season by his singular style of play . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and gave up var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] easy points off turnovers to give away Friday 's game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost five of their last six games , and they 'll try to stop the bleeding when they host the Phoenix Suns on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Thursday at the Staples Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] left the game in the first quarter with a broken right hand and did not return to the game . It is unclear how long var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] will be out with the injury , but some reports suggested he could miss a few as var_player[1][4][PF] weeks . With Kevin_Durant already sidelined due to foot surgery for at least the first month of the season , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are in danger of digging a hole to start their season that may be too deep to crawl out of and reach the playoffs in the Western Conference . In addition to Durant , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are also dealing with injuries to var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] , Mitch_McGary , var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] , Grant_Jerrett , and var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] . They may only have eight healthy players for their next game if no one returns to action Saturday against the Denver Nuggets . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] could n't create much separation from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] despite all of the injuries the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are dealing with . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was brought in this offseason to help shore up the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt depth by giving them a versatile shooter off the bench . It was expected var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] might carve out a big enough role to steal some minutes from starters var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , but that was n't the case in the opener as var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] played just var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench , while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] played var_player[0][1][MIN] and var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] played var_player[0][2][MIN] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finish off a back - to - back set to start the season on Friday when they play Lakers .
var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] held off var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's strong start and claimed a resounding var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] victory in their home opener . The third pick of the 2015 draft , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , was the story of the game in his debut . He put up 26 points and seven rebounds on 10 - 16 shooting from the field and 6 - 6 from the line . The rookie also committed eight turnovers . Unfortunately , his effort was n't enough to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the game . The other bright spot for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was second year forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who filled up the stat sheet with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_team[1][TEAM-AST] rebounds , var_player[1][1][BLK] assists , var_player[1][1][OREB] steals , and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] also chipped in var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will welcome Utah into town Friday , and will look for their first win of the season . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] off the bench with var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][AST] assists in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes of action . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] front court looks to be a fluid situation to start the season with var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] starting but only playing 10 minutes . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] played var_player[0][5][MIN] and var_player[0][8][MIN] minutes respectively off the bench , while newly aquired var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] started and played var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will play at home again Friday versus Toronto and look to start the season 20 .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday . After var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] beat the undefeated Golden_State Warriors in their most recent game , fans hoped they came out of their slump . Clearly not , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] handled them here in a blowout win . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had a 20 - point lead after three quarters and this game was well out of hand before the final buzzer . The rebounding was the big difference , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] grabbed var_team[0][TEAM-REB] to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hit var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - of - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - for - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it does n't matter much anymore after losing to a var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - win var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there does n't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][REB] assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] and that left them with very little post presence . var_player[1][12][SECOND_NAME] missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's next game against the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] Clippers on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] leading the team with var_player[0][0][PTS] points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] both played well here . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] recorded a var_player[0][7][PTS] point - var_player[0][7][PTS] rebound double - double , while var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] amassed var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][FGM] assists and var_player[0][7][PF] rebounds . It 's rare to see this var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] fans . They 'll look to build off this rare win , when they take in the Houston Rockets on Thursday in their next scheduled game .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has taken advantage of a relatively easy part of their schedule to win four straight and eight of their last nine . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] has started to break through his early - season rust and scored the game - high in points for the second straight game , finishing with var_player[0][3][PTS] points Sunday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] help the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting while converting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their own shots from the field to secure the win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost 11 of their last 12 games . They were without Derrick_Favors ( ankle ) on Sunday , but Favors is travelling with the team on their six - game road trip , indicating that he could return sooner than later . Sophomore center var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] earned the first start of his career in Favors ' absence . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] put up var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FGM] blocks in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . At 7 - 1 , he has the tools to be one of the best shot blockers in the league if given the minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue their road trip in New_Orleans on Tuesday against the Pelicans .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - 35 ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday thanks to var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] 's late - second game - winner . This game had an exciting finish with both teams giving blows all the way down to the final whistle . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] hit a var_player[0][7][FTA] - pointer with var_player[0][7][FGM] seconds left to take a three - point lead , but var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] followed that with a game - tying var_player[0][7][TO] with var_player[1][0][FG3A] seconds left for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . On the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next possession , var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] fumbled the ball before regaining possession and hitting a wild fade away for the winning margin with one second left . The bench scoring was the big difference for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as they got 55 bench points to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-AST] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] did a great job of hanging around in this game , but just could n't prevail late . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] carried the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as he tallied var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][STL] steals and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks in the loss . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] also had a nice game , as he amassed var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists in the defeat . This gave them their 13th loss in their last 15 games and it does n't get much easier against the Detroit Pistons on Monday in their next game . This gives var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] seven wins in their last var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] games and the `` must - win '' homestand is really helping this team back into the playoff hunt . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] missed the last var_player[0][1][BLK] games with a concussion , but played big here . While var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] started var_player[0][1][STL] - for - var_player[0][1][FGM] from the field in the first half , he still finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] was great down the stretch , as he finished with var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][AST] assists . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] also continued his recent hot stretch , as he accumulated var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][FG3M] assists in the win . Up next for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . In what looked like a lopsided matchup on paper , proved to be one on the court . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] used their defense to pull out the win , as they held the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] points on var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] percent shooting . The fastbreak differential was huge as well , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] getting 27 fastbreak points to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] two . Despite barely clearing 100 points , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field in the victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has been one of the best defenses in the league over recent weeks and absolutely shut down the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in this game . No var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] player played particularly well , but they got some great performances from their bench . var_player[1][7][FIRST_NAME] Schroeder led the team with var_player[1][7][PTS] points off the bench and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] nearly double - doubled in his var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] debut . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was extremely efficient , as he scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points , while going var_player[1][3][DREB] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field . It 's a good thing the starters got a nice rest here , as they play again on Saturday against the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] Clippers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has been playing more competitively recently , but this was a downright ugly performance . They were without Kobe_Bryant , Lou_Williams and Jordan_Clarkson though , so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] really struggled , as he went var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field after averaging nearly 27 points a game across his last four games . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the only Laker who played well , as he double - doubled in a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound game . On deck for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] is a nightmare matchup against the Golden_State Warriors on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came into this matchup as a double - digit favorite , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took them down to the wire . The key for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] was their defense , as they held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent shooting from three - point range . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was great from long distance as well , as they went var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - for - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] in the win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is in the midst of a rough stretch right now , but this was a great performance despite the result . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][2][BLK] of his best games of the season , as he scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while also snatching down var_player[1][1][FG3A] rebounds in the loss . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][PF] assists . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be on Sunday , when they take on the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] Lakers . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't play their best ball in this game , but still prevailed with a win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was a beast down low , as he snatched down var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and swatted away var_player[0][2][BLK] shots in the win . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while also dishing out var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][0][BLK] of his best games in a Clipper uniform , as he accumulated var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . All five var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters scored in double - figures in their victory . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to keep this going on Sunday against the Cleveland Cavaliers in their next game .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the AT & T Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . In this very low scoring matchup , both teams struggled from the field . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to take the advantage from the free throw line as well , converting on 19 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] attempts , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] made only var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - of - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] attempts . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also struggled with turnovers , as they committed var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] throughout the game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][2][FTM] rebounds in just under var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . He 's only reached double figures in points six other times this season , so it was good to see him have a productive outing . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a solid showing , going var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while adding var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds . He 's been very productive for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] over his last three games , averaging 17 points over that span . Coming var_player[0][0][BLK] rebound shy of a double - double , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][AST] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . After returning from an injury on Friday that had kept him out of the lineup for a month , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] recorded 20 points , so he came back down to earth a little bit in this matchup . Both var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] played limited minutes , scoring var_player[0][1][AST] ( var_player[0][1][TO] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG ) and 12 points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FGA] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) respectively . Also coming off the bench , var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] added a double - double with var_player[0][8][PTS] points and var_player[0][8][REB] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] just could n't get in a rhythm offensively against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as only two players reached double figures in points . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in , scoring var_player[1][5][PTS] points and grabbing an impressive var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds in 28 minutes .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] rode a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point first quarter to an early lead and never trailed in the final three quarters as the home squad shot the lights out . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot a pristine var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - 17 ) from three - point land , an efficient attack that was too much for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to handle . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hit var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] threes of their own , but were manhandled on the boards , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] won the rebounding battle var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] notched a triple - double for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] as he dropped var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds and var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] assists on var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points each and both tallied double - doubles , as var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] distributed var_player[0][1][REB] assists and var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] pulled down var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] did what he could off the bench to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in it , as he knocked down var_player[1][6][PTS] points on a smooth var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] shooting night , including var_player[1][6][FG3M] three - pointers . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starters with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] suffered a terrible var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] shooting night and managed just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] also could n't get it going , as he managed only var_player[1][1][DREB] points on var_player[1][1][FGA] field goal attempts over var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes of action . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will face the Spurs on Saturday back in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in a marquee inter - conference matchup .

Center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a career - high and franchise - record var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds to lead the team to victory .

While var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] was the game 's biggest story , shattering his personal rebounding record while also scoring var_player[1][2][DREB] points on just var_player[1][2][FGA] field goal attempts and recording a pair of blocks , All-Star var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] also had a big night . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points and neared a triple - double , also recording var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][REB] assists . Fellow All-Star guard var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's scoring while getting to the free - throw line var_player[1][0][FTA] times .

The team has surpassed all expectations , rivaling the Cleveland Cavaliers for the top of the Eastern Conference headed down the stretch . After Thursday 's win , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] sits just two games out of the number one spot . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , had an equally horrific shooting night , going just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . Star var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][FG3A] rebounds , but no var_player[0][0][FG3M] Pacer took over the game in the way var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] backcourt were able to . Guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] came up with var_player[0][3][STL] big steals and dished out var_player[0][3][AST] assists , but shot just var_player[0][3][PF] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] on the night . The loss puts var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] more firmly in the seventh slot in the Eastern Conference , and Thursday 's matchup looks as though it may be a playoff preview if seeding remains constant for the rest of the season . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will host the ailing Boston Celtics on Friday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will see the powerhouse Oklahoma_City Thunder on Saturday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday night . This win gave var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] their third - straight and they 've done that without Damian_Lillard . The starters were the big difference in the game , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starting - five outscored var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's 76 - 53 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defense struggled yet again , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot nearly 50 percent from the field . The game was close throughout , but var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] continued to keep a distance from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and simply held them off til the final whistle . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is in the midst of a terrible slump right now , as this loss marks their seventh in their last eight games . It 's not just the defense that has slowed this team down , as both ends of the floor are a struggle right now . Much of that can be attributed to the injuries and it 's hard to imagine this team playing consistently until they are fully healthy . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] played his homecoming game here and performed spectacularly , tallying var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][FTA] assists in the defeat . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] also played well , as he scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points and grabbed var_player[1][3][FTA] rebounds . The good news is that Danilo_Gallinari , var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] are all due back to return within a week and this team will be greatly improved with those three starters back in the fold . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] wo n't play again until Saturday when they take on the Golden_State Warriors in a game where they 'll surely be huge underdogs . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been playing without Damian_Lillard recently and playing well . He is unarguably the star of the team , but C.J . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] is doing a heck of a job controlling the offense in his absence . He had yet another great game here , as he contributed 29 points , three rebounds and four assists in the win . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] also had var_player[0][3][AST] of his best games of the season , as he scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points and grabbed var_player[0][3][DREB] boards . This young team is showing some promise and they should be an interesting team once Lillard returns . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be on Thursday against the Utah Jazz .

Outside of var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , neither team played a pretty game of basketball , and the heavy blow to var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] is leaving many var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fans in disbelief given their playoffs track record . var_player[1][10][FIRST_NAME] left the game after he fractured third metacarpal on his right hand according to Rowan Kavner of Clippers.com , but will undergo further tests when the team flies back to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] is dealing with a bruised heel and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] briefly left the contest with soreness in his left quad .

Prior to var_player[1][10][FIRST_NAME] leaving the game , he was the main difference maker for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] success in the first half , as he was responsible for his team 's first 10 points on 5 - of - 5 shooting , but eventually cooled off and finished with var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points , var_player[1][10][REB] rebound and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][11][FIRST_NAME] Greene and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] aided the starters with a combined 29 points off the bench , while var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][AST] assists on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][FGA] shooting .

Coming out of the third quarter up just 80 - 76 , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had a fantastic fourth quarter both offensively and defensively , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] to secure the 10 - point victory on the road . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to shoot 11 - for - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot just 5 - of - 14 , which may have been the difference in this one . After playing in only 23 minutes during Sunday 's game against the Utah Jazz , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] returned to playing a full minutes load , finishing with a team - high of var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][OREB] - var_player[1][4][FG3M] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][PF] FT ) , while also adding var_player[1][4][AST] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes .

He went 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 17 points , while recording 15 rebounds .

He went a perfect 3 - for - 3 from the field and 9 - for - 9 from the free throw line to score 15 points in only 15 minutes . In Sunday 's game he had 12 points and 11 rebounds , so he was able to stay hot in the victory . For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did most of the damage against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , marking his first double - double in the last var_player[0][1][PF] games . He only scored a combined 13 points over his last two outings , so it was a huge bounce back game for him . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] on the other hand shot var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][TO] - for - var_player[0][3][FGM] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while adding var_player[0][3][STL] steals . He had only two points in Monday 's loss to the Warriors , so like var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] , it was good to see him turn things around . Rookie center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] nearly had a double - double of his own , finishing with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][FGA] rebounds . He 's now averaging 7 points and 6 rebounds so far this season . The only other Nugget to reach double figures in points was var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] who had var_player[0][0][FGA] points ( var_player[0][0][REB] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][0][OREB] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][OREB] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) in 37 minutes .

Throughout the course of this , his final season , 20 - year - veteran var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] has certainly had his ups and downs . He 's gone through long stretches where he 's struggled with his shot , and due to his generally unremarkable numbers , his election to the All-Star team has been derided by some as a somewhat undeserved distinction . However , over the last var_player[1][0][OREB] contests , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] has turned back the clock and resembled the legendary figure that has earned the many accolades he 's received throughout his retirement tour .

His contributions were particularly relevant on a night when backcourt mate var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] could only manage var_player[0][1][OREB] points , var_player[0][1][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][4][PTS] steals , and during which var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] was the only other starter to post double - digit points . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was outstanding off the bench , supplying a near double - double in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes of action with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][FGM] assists , a steal and a block . However , he missed an opportunity to send the game into overtime when he misfired on a 25 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was n't far behind with a productive effort of his own , totaling var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][DREB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Saturday night .

The 21 - year - old played only 14 minutes and picked up four fouls while scoring only two points . A big night from var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] was n't necessary for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's success , though , as var_player[0][2][OREB] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] scored at least 20 points on the night .

For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , Karl Anthony var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] was nearly unstoppable , shooting var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][2][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][2][FG3A] from behind the arc en route to scoring a team - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points and grabbing var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's other star , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , struggled mightily Tuesday night , scoring var_player[0][0][PTS] points in a very poor var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting from the field . In the end , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lost the game because they were n't able to hit their outside shots , as var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] and shooting guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined to shoot var_player[0][3][FG3_PCT] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] from var_player[0][3][REB] - point range , while as a team , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot var_player[0][0][REB] - of - 20 from behind the arc .

In fact , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] pulled out the wire - to - wire win , while holding a double - digit lead for the final 20 - plus minutes . Shooting was key , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] hitting var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shooting only var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] percent from long range .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent from the free - throw line and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also out - assisted var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] and simply looked like the better team on Tuesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] prevailed in the first game between these two teams , but just did n't play well enough to win on Tuesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who continues to prove that Madison Square Garden is var_player[1][4][TO] of his favorite places to play . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steals in the loss .

They were led by rookie var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied a career - high var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds in the win .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had been on a roll , having won four of their last six and sitting comfortably in the playoff picture . The team struggled on Tuesday , however , shooting just 39 percent and proving unable to defend against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's powerful perimeter shooters . Stars var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] impressed per usual , scoring var_player[1][2][PTS] and var_player[1][4][PTS] respectively .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't provide an update on his condition before the game ended .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are now positioned to close out this best of game series on their home floor with Games 3 and 4 at the Verizon Center . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will have an uphill climb to get back into this series after dropping its first var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] games at home . That uphill climb is made tougher by the fact that star point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] is clearly less than 100 percent . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes on the floor and did not play in the final 5:56 . He appeared to suffer a foot injury in the fourth and was hindered by a number of injuries down over the last month of the regular season . The bright spots for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were var_player[0][3][FIRST_NAME] Derozan and Sixth Man of the Year Louis var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] scoring var_player[0][7][PTS] points apiece . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] now face a must - win game Friday in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Monday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has surprised many by holding the third - best record in the Western Conference over a third of the way through the season . On Monday , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] looked as strong as ever , due in large part to the strong play of superstar var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] predictably took over the game , scoring var_player[0][4][PTS] points and dishing out var_player[0][4][AST] assists , both team highs . Sixth man var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , continued to be a key part of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' newfound high - paced offensive attack . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][5][PTS] points and hit var_player[0][5][FG3M] three - pointers . As a team , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had 15 three - pointers and shot an impressive var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , on the other hand , sits near the bottom of the Western Conference for the second straight season . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have won just three of their last eight contests . On Monday , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] started the game off by accumulating a huge deficit , trailing 39 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] by the end of the first quarter . Point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , however , continued to impress , scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] points to go with var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will visit Dallas on Tuesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to San_Antonio on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have earned had a reputation as a gritty , blue - collar team that tends to dominate in the paint , with rebounders such as var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] often leading the way . However , the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' performance Friday may be indicative of a changing of the guard in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division , where both teams reside . The home team largely controlled matters down low , hauling in a collective 51 boards and scoring var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] of their 104 points in the paint , as compared to 28 for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and reserve forward var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] surprisingly spearheaded the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' rebounding efforts with var_player[0][4][REB] apiece , and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][5][DREB] ) and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][DREB] ) pitched in with strong board totals as well . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's frontcourt had been particularly maligned early in the season , but var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] appears to be settling in nicely as the unquestioned starting center , and players like var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] have been making consistently strong contributions around the basket as well . var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] could only muster var_player[0][4][PTS] points to go along with the var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , but others picked up the slack scoring - wise . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] followed up a var_player[0][1][FG3_PCT] - point outburst versus Washington on Tuesday with a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point effort , while C.J . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] continued his string of strong offensive showings with var_player[0][0][PTS] points . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] rounded out a strong night for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's starting var_player[0][3][AST] with var_player[0][2][PTS] and var_player[0][3][PTS] points , respectively . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] poured in var_player[0][5][PTS] to pace the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' bench and tally his first double - double of the season . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head to Los_Angeles to face off against the Lakers on Sunday .

Notably , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] totaled only var_player[1][2][PTS] points , marking his third single - digit scoring night of the season . He did manage 11 boards , giving him double - digit rebounds in five of his last six outings . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the reserves with var_player[1][5][PTS] points over var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently resides in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home for a date with the Spurs on Monday .
var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's stifling defense held the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to a season - low scoring total , while also limiting them to a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with a var_player[1][0][PTS] - point , var_player[1][0][AST] - assist double - double , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[1][1][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] posted a pair of var_player[1][2][FGA] - point efforts , and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to tally a var_player[1][7][FGA] - point , var_player[1][7][REB] - rebound double - double over var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . A nightmarish outing for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] saw var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] pace them in scoring with a modest var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a pair of var_player[0][1][PTS] - point tallies on a combined var_player[0][2][REB] - of - var_player[0][1][MIN] shooting . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had matching var_player[0][4][PTS] - point contributions . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] actually served as the second - leading scorer on the team despite coming off the bench , posting var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][FGA] rebounds in var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has won four straight games , and they 've been without starting small forward DeMarre_Carroll ( groin ) for the last two games . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] has been filling in admirably in Carroll 's stead . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points Friday . He was one of eight var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] players to finish with double - digit points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is on a two - game losing streak , but their struggles against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were explainable with Dwyane_Wade sitting out with a minor hamstring injury . var_player[1][3][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] received the spot start in place of Wade , but it was var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench who showed up big . He had a double - double with a team - high 23 points and 11 assists in 40 mintues . Wade is questionable to play in the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's next game Sunday at home against the Milwaukee Bucks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will finish off their back - to - back set Saturday in Cleveland against the Cavaliers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) continued their undefeated streak at home Saturday by beating the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] pulled off the unlikely task of beating the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in their last meeting on Christmas , but this one followed a much more common script . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ran away with a dominating victory and really took it to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . It was a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - 7 run in the third quarter that really put some distance between these teams and var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] could never recover after that . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] killed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with their own recipe , by hitting 13 - of - 24 three - pointers en route to the blowout . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's defense has really let them down all year and that was the case yet again here . They allowed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to shoot over var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and allowed far too many open threes . Most of the starters struggled aside from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] . The var_player[1][3][PTS] points that var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] scored is extremely low for him , and he really did n't make any sort of impact in the second half . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] did record a double - double though , as he collected var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds in the defeat . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was expected to lose this game , but the fashion they did it in was ugly yet again and one has to wonder if big changes are coming . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce back on Monday against the Utah Jazz . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has been dominating with their defense this season , but the offense carried them tonight . They rank first in every significant defensive statistic , but also rank third in offensive efficiency . They surely added to that efficiency rating here , as they shot over 50 percent from the field and three - point range while dishing out an impressive 31 assists . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] was the star of the show off the bench , as he tallied var_player[0][9][PTS] points and var_player[0][9][FGM] boards in just var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] also hit a season - high var_player[0][3][FGM] var_player[0][3][STL] 's en route to an var_player[0][3][PTS] - point outing with a solid all - around line . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has now won 20 - straight home games and they are truly one of the best teams in basketball right now . They 'll play the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday in their next scheduled game .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] returned to the active lineup for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] after missing extended time with an eye infection . He started at small forward and played 24 minutes . With Tiago_Splitter ( back/calf ) still sidelined , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was given a spot start at power forward to matchup with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' small - ball power forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] played var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes and finished with var_player[1][2][FG3A] points . var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] , who started the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' opener at center did not get off the bench against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] played a career - high var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes and finished with var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds to record the first double - double of his NBA career . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] did his damage off the bench , while starting center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] played just var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , a development that does n't mean much in the course of var_player[0][2][OREB] game , but after the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] , his development is something they 're going to be keen to push , and that may come at the expense of var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] at some point . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] lead the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with a team - high var_player[0][7][PTS] points off the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have four days off before their next game at home Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will finish a back - to - back set on the road Saturday against the Utah Jazz .
When var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] took a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - point lead headed into the half , this game appeared to be over . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had other ideas though , as they sent this game into overtime , with var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] hitting a game - winner with var_player[1][0][FG3M] seconds left to seal the comeback victory . Fastbreak points was the only true advantage for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the stat sheet , as they won that differential , 15 - 7 . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] each recorded double - doubles , combining for 28 points and 26 rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . The showdown between two of the most high - powered offenses in the Western Conference lived up to its billing , with the respective stars on both teams playing an integral part in lighting up the scoreboard . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] held a 58 - 55 lead at intermission , and were scoring with relative ease throughout the first two quarters . However , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] made a concerted effort to clamp down in the second half , a strategy that was largely effective as evidenced by the 38 and var_team[0][TEAM-AST] percent tallies from the field and three - point range , respectively , that the visitors finished with . The home team also played much more efficiently around the basket , outrebounding var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 57 to var_team[1][TEAM-REB] and outscoring them in the paint , 58 - 50 . Even after var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's 80 run cut the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lead to 112 - 106 with 1:20 remaining , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] insured that matters would end there by pressing var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] on his last - gasp , 14 - foot step - back jump shot with var_player[1][3][FTA] seconds remaining and grabbing the subsequent rebound . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][3][REB] assists , var_player[1][3][PF] steals and a block . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was next , registering var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds , an assist and a block .

Despite the loss , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home to face the Wizards on Saturday .

After missing the last var_player[0][1][STL] games with an ankle sprain , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] returned in a dominant fashion , as the tandem of he and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] were nearly unstoppable in the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' ( 31 - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) victory Wednesday night . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][2][PTS] points and grabbed a game - high var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] still managed to score a game - high var_player[0][1][PTS] points and grab var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds of his own .

OKC also dominated on the glass , where the team held a 52 - 38 rebounding advantage .

Game 4 will take place on Tuesday night , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] looks to take a 3 - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] lead before hitting the road again .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ended up hitting 22 of those , which destroyed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] nine makes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took advantage of the turnover differential , as they won that battle , 23 - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he tallied var_player[1][2][MIN] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points of his own , adding var_player[1][0][STL] steals to his tally . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] each recorded double - doubles as well . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as he accumulated 21 points , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . All var_player[0][1][FGM] starters scored at least var_player[0][1][FGA] points , as var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team with var_player[0][1][PTS] points . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to combine for 31 points , six assists and var_player[0][5][FGM] steals .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , compared to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , which tells the gross part of the story as to how they came away with the win . They did n't sell the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] any buckets . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has lost 13 straight games in what has been a nightmarish start to the season . Coach Stan Van Gundy has tried to be patient with his rotations and starting lineup , but the players have n't rewarded him with much in the win column . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point , var_player[0][5][FGM] - rebound double - double in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench was the only bright spot from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . They could have Jodie_Meeks ( back ) make his season debut in Friday 's game , and it 'll be interesting to see if a single role player can help them dig out of the hole they 've dug .
var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][REB] - rebound , var_player[0][4][AST] - assist triple - double paced var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , while var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a near double - double of var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][0][PTS] points , and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][1][PTS] . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][REB] boards , var_player[0][7][PF] assists and var_player[0][7][STL] steal . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] put together an excellent defensive effort as well , limiting the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points in the fourth quarter and eliciting var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers from them . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] fought through an illness and took the court for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , posting a team - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] posted a bench - leading var_player[1][8][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] contributed a near double - double of var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , who was in danger of missing the contest , supplied var_player[1][6][PTS] points in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes .
This was one of the closest games of the season , as there were 10 ties and 21 lead changes in total , with neither team leading by more than seven at any point . Free-throw shooting was the difference for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they went var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - of - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] went just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - of - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the star , as he led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , adding var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists to his tally .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] saw a classic night from star point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] on Sunday . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored a whopping var_player[1][4][PTS] points , shooting var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][4][FTM] from the free - throw line . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] shot var_player[1][4][FG3M] - of - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from beyond the arc as well . Recently acquired big man var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] also had a big night , going for var_player[1][2][PTS] points along with 12 rebounds . Six of those rebounds came on the offensive end , and var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] also blocked var_player[1][2][BLK] shots on the night . Guard C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] also impressed , scoring var_player[1][3][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][3][AST] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FG3A] assists . For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was fairly impressive . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][2][PTS] points to go with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] steals , and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . However , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] had foul trouble , ending the night with var_player[0][2][DREB] personals . Sixth man var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench for var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds , and var_player[0][6][AST] assists .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . Coming into the 2015 - 2016 NBA season , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was looked at as a major work in progress , but the result of the No . 4 overall pick has given the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fans something to really cheer for . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] finished the night with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][BLK] block on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting , including var_player[1][1][FG3M] var_player[1][1][TO] - pointers and a perfect var_player[1][1][FTM] - of - var_player[1][1][FTA] from the free throw line . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] has made a meaningful impact in his return to the starting lineup over the past few games , helping out from the var_player[1][3][AST] - point line as well , as he drained var_player[1][3][FG3M] var_player[1][3][AST] - pointers from deep in the effort . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was efficient in his var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] minutes played , scoring var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][PF] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field , including a layup with 0:39 left in the 4th quarter which extended the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] lead by var_player[1][0][DREB] . Six var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' finished in double figures , but it was not enough to win in front of their hometown crowd . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , finishing with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists on var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , who finished second overall in the MVP voting last season , is struggling with efficiency from the floor , shooting var_player[0][3][MIN] percent overall . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] rounded out the rest of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in double figures , but the all around effort was not enough to secure a win . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] recently fired head coach var_player[1][6][FIRST_NAME] McHale with interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defensive efficiency ranks in the lower third of the league , and letting up var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] points to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will not help that cause going forward . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to bounce back against the Memphis Grizzlies ( 7 - 7 ) at home on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] visit the Miami Heat ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - 4 ) on Monday .
var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was sensational in the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's var_player[1][4][REB] - point win Monday over the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , and with that effort , it looks as if the point guard is returning to the form of the All-NBA player he was back in 2014 . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored a team - high var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] points and dished out var_player[1][4][AST] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , but what was most impressive was his shooting performance , as the Yugoslavian hit var_player[1][4][FG3M] - of - var_player[1][4][AST] shots from behind the arc and var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shots from the field overall . And this is starting to become a more regular occurrence for var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , as following Monday 's performance , he has now shot at least 55 percent from the field in five of his last six contests , and he is shooting 60 percent from the field and an absurd 75 percent from three - point range . But on top of all the scoring , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has remained a playmaker , dishing out 8 assists per game over that same stretch .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at United Center on Saturday night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had checked in to Saturday night uncharacteristically struggling , particularly on defense . They 'd lost four of their five games coming out of the All-Star break and had surrendered over 120 points in three of those contests . However , they got back to fundamental var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] basketball against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , limiting them to var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range , while also eliciting var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] turnovers . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up off the bench by scoring a game - high var_player[1][7][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][7][PF] rebounds , var_player[1][7][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][7][PF] steal , and four other players also hit double digits in the scoring column . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was next behind var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[1][7][FGA] points , var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists , var_player[1][4][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[1][4][FTA] steals and var_player[1][7][DREB] block . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was effective in his usual complementary role , registering var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][REB] rebound . var_player[1][0][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] a Moute had a rare offensive outburst by his standards , totaling var_player[1][0][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][PF] assist and var_player[1][0][TO] steal . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] generated a modest var_player[1][2][PTS] points but did haul in var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , dish out var_player[1][2][FGM] assists and record a steal . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][AST] assists , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][STL] steals . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] generated var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][2][DREB] assists . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][1][FGA] points and brought down var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][PF] assists and var_player[0][3][FG3M] steal . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[0][9][PTS] points and var_player[0][9][PF] rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the Boston Celtics on Monday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head to Detroit to take on the Pistons in a Monday evening showdown .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took care of the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] victory on Tuesday . This appeared to be a lopsided matchup on paper and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took it to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . It was the second and third quarters that made a difference , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] outscored var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 59 to 38 in that stretch . The rebounding was a huge difference , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bringing down var_team[1][TEAM-REB] rebounds to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] . The three - point shooting was a factor as well , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent , while var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot over var_team[1][TEAM-REB] percent . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played this game without var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] and did n't miss a beat . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up in their absences , as he accumulated var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FG3M] rebounds in just var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] filled - in admirably for var_player[1][12][SECOND_NAME] as he double - doubled in a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound outing . On deck for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] is a matchup against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday . This loss snapped a three - game winning streak for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] both tied the team - lead with 19 points , with no other player scoring more than var_player[0][0][FGA] . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] actually flirted with a triple - double yet again , as he tallied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists in the defeat . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to play better on Thursday against the shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies in their next game .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

Conversely , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] struggled , as he shot just var_player[0][5][FGM] - of - var_player[0][5][FGA] from the field on his way to var_player[0][5][AST] points in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] were able to make positive contributions in their reserve roles , scoring var_player[0][9][PTS] and var_player[0][8][PTS] points respectively . The win is just var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's third in 10 games , and they currently boast the third worst record in the NBA . It was a quick fall back to reality for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as just a day after upsetting the Grizzlies and ending a 10 - game losing streak , they lost to one of the NBA 's worst teams . They were without Greg_Monroe , who sat out his second consecutive game with a strained knee . Despite the loss , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] did have some strong performances . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed up Tuesday night 's big game with a triple - double , putting up var_player[1][4][PTS] points on just var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][4][PTS] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] also followed up his 24 - point performance on Tuesday in a strong way , scoring var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting and grabbing var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes .

Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Knicks at home Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head home Saturday to take on the Bulls .

The three - point shooting killed var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as they went 3 - for - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] going var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - for - 22 on their end . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has had many of these garbage time games and it shows just how powerful this var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] team is . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][0][PTS] points and did that in under var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes of play . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued his recent strong play , as he double - doubled in the blowout . The bench scored 58 points in the win and brought eight players off the pine . The rest for the starters was good news , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] play the second half of a back - to - back on Saturday against the Los_Angeles Lakers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has been competitive in nearly every game this season , but this was not one of those games . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench nearly doubled up the scoring of the starters , as mop - up time started very early . No player on the team scored more than var_player[0][9][PTS] points , with var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] tying foe the team - lead .

The game was all but over , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] closed out the game easily .

Terrance var_player[0][9][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] each added var_player[1][11][PTS] points , and overall , it was a fairly forgettable night for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . With the `` hack - a '' strategy , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was never able to get in any offensive rhythm with all the stoppages of play , and they clearly suffered because of it . Game 5 is scheduled for Tuesday , with tip - off coming at 9:30 p.m. EST .

Despite the loss , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by a double - double from center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] who scored var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points and grabbed var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . He has now recorded 10 or more rebounds in an impressive 11 of 14 games this season . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] came var_player[1][1][FTA] rebounds shy of his own double - double , and he finished the game with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . With var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] sitting out , D.J . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was the starter at point guard . He shot 4 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 11 points , while handing out seven assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench struggled to offer any help , as they had only 20 of the var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] total points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) fended off the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at the United Center on Monday evening . Entering the fourth quarter with a six - point deficit facing them , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] whittled away at the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' lead and finally knotted up the score at 100 with just under three minutes remaining . Thereafter , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] received scoring contributions from var_player[0][7][DREB] different players , but their push in the final period was ultimately powered by rookie var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who spearheaded a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - point explosion with a combined var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points , nine rebounds , and var_player[0][0][STL] three - pointers . In the end , a var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] squad without Mike_Dunleavy ( ankle ) achieved its third victory in a row , and 10th in 11 contests , on the backs of a complete team effort led by var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . Meanwhile , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] toughed out a right hip contusion en route to var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . By the final horn , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had accumulated a whopping 12 blocks , var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] steals , and 30 free - throw attempts , of which they knocked down var_team[0][TEAM-AST] . On the other side , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_player[1][5][PF] - var_player[1][5][OREB] with newcomer var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , despite his team - high var_player[1][5][PTS] points on var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][5][FGA] from the field . While var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a customary , but underwhelming double - double ( var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards ) , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was perhaps the primary reason for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's downfall , missing all var_player[1][3][FG3M] field goal attempts and committing var_player[1][3][FG3M] fouls , including a charge for var_player[1][2][AST] of his var_player[1][3][BLK] turnovers in the fourth quarter . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] still managed a stat - laden line , recording var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FG3M] assists , var_player[1][3][BLK] rebounds , var_player[1][3][BLK] blocks , and var_player[1][3][STL] steal in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes , and backcourt mate var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] aided the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' effort further with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . However , knocking down only 8 - for - 25 from three - point range did n't do them any favors in the loss . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will continue their three - game road swing Wednesday in Cleveland , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home for Wednesday 's outing against the Jazz .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fended off a strong second half from var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to defeat the host var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , on Friday at Golden 1 Center . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) started out strong with a 68 - point first half and headed into the locker room up by 18 .

This was the first of a five - game road trip for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who take - on the Trail_Blazers on Sunday . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the high - point man for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , with var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting , including var_player[0][2][FTA] - of - var_player[0][2][REB] from long range . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] poured in var_player[0][2][TO] three - pointers in the final quarter as part of a comeback rally by the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , but it was not enough . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] stayed with their smaller lineup , keeping var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] at center and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] at power forward . However , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] struggled in this var_player[0][0][PF] , going var_player[0][0][FG3A] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] from the field on his way to var_player[0][0][PTS] points . This was the final game of a five - game home stand for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , which they finished 2 - 3 . They now head out on a six - game road trip beginning in Brooklyn on Sunday .

They are allowing under 88 points a game at home this season and this result actually lowered that league - leading average . That was key again here , as they held var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also dominated the rebounding , winning that battle var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 37 . The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] starters outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starters 70 - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has had to play some tough competition lately and it 's no easy task to play in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] right now . All the starters struggled , as they combined for just 32 points , with only one player scoring in double figures . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , as he dropped 15 points and var_player[1][5][AST] assists off the bench . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was second on the team , as he tallied var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][7][BLK] assists , var_player[1][7][AST] steals and var_player[1][7][AST] blocks off the pine . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] . combined to go 7 - of - 25 , with no player reaching double figures in any stat aside from minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be on Friday , when they travel to play the Memphis Grizzlies . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has really struggled recently , but a home game against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] is just what the doctor ordered . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , tallying var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds on var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double , accruing var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][BLK] steals and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks in the win . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists of his own . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be a tough one , as they host the Los_Angeles Clippers on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took care of business on their home court Thursday night , as they defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) at United Center , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] Trailing 43 - 33 with 3:58 to go in the second quarter , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] kicked it into high gear to end the half , closing the quarter with a 15 - 4 run to take a 48 - 47 halftime lead . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][1][REB] of the 15 points of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] run on var_player[0][1][FGM] field goals , including var_player[0][1][FG3M] deep three - pointers .

All var_player[0][4][DREB] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters scored at least 10 points , including var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who chipped in var_player[0][4][PTS] on a crisp var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] shooting . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench chipped in from the three - point line , as var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] combined to knock down seven of the team 's var_player[0][8][PTS] three - pointers , helping the team shoot var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] points despite a poor var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][PTS] shooting night . His shooting woes were contagious , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] struggled to connect as a team . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[1][1][PTS] points on a var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting night , was the only Celtic to shoot at least 50 percent , and the team shot just 35 - 98 ( 36 percent ) from the floor . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was a bright spot , as he came off the bench to score var_player[1][6][PTS] points and grab var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds in only var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have now lost four of five and remain on the road for their next contest Sunday in Memphis . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] extended their winning streak to six and will look to extend it Saturday in Atlanta .
It 's usually the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] showcasing their defense , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] gave var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] a bit of their own medicine in this surprising win .

Coming into Sunday , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were looking to reestablish their confidence after falling flat in their first game without Kevin_Durant ( knee ) on Thursday . The prolific Splash Bros made sure of that , putting together a performance that hearkened back to last season by combining for 60 points , including nine three - pointers . No other player on the team scored more than 13 but it proved to be enough to hold off a feisty var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) squad that kept matters close until the closing minute . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] got a pair of standout performances in their own right from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who nearly matched var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] basket - for - basket with 53 combined points of their own . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] notably lost the rebound battle by a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] margin , but took much better care of the ball , turning it over only var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] times as compared the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] led the way with a game - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][DREB] assists and var_player[1][3][PF] steals . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was right behind him with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] boards , var_player[1][4][STL] assist and var_player[1][4][PF] steal . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] filled out the stat sheet with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FGM] assists , var_player[1][1][STL] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] block . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][AST] assists , var_player[1][2][BLK] rebound , var_player[1][2][BLK] steal and var_player[1][2][REB] block . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] shooting from the floor and a var_player[0][4][FTM] - of - var_player[0][4][FTA] tally from the free - throw line .

With his var_player[0][0][FTM] teammates taking on such expanded roles Sunday , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a rather modest var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FTM] assists and var_player[0][0][AST] blocks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] surprisingly went scoreless over var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes , although he did supply var_player[0][1][REB] boards and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][9][PF] assist . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] now head south to the Peach var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for a Monday night showdown with the Atlanta Hawks , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] travel to Central Florida to tangle with the Orlando Magic on Monday evening as well .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did nothing to assuage the concerns Head Coach Kevin McHale had expressed less than 48 hours ago , failing to reach 100 points for the second consecutive game while suffering a second straight loss . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had endured a similar scoring drought over the season 's first three contests before breaking out of their offensive slump by averaging 113 points over the next var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] outings , all victories . A lack of support for var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points ) seems to have played a large part in dooming the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' quest for victory Friday , with backcourt mate var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] somehow failing to score over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes on the floor . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did enjoy a resurgent performance from var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , who had himself been shut out over 16 minutes in his return Thursday folowing a var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - game absence prompted by a facial laceration . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] came off the bench Friday to post a highly - efficient var_player[1][6][PTS] - point , var_player[1][6][REB] - rebound , var_player[1][6][FG3A] - block performance over just var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes of court time . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] also contributed var_player[1][0][PTS] points , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] tallied a fourth consecutive double - double with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards .

J.J. var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] also tallied double - digit scoring contributions in starting and reserve roles , respectively . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] improved their record to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and are currently in second place in the Pacific Division 's Northwest Division .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this one , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc .

Forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a particularly big night , scoring var_player[1][1][PTS] points and pulling down var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds to go along with four blocks . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , it was the same story as usual . Point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , and C.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] finished behind him with var_player[0][3][PTS] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] also contributed var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][DREB] assists .

He put up 12 points and 19 rebounds in 34 minutes Sunday for a double - double , and he has now strung together four consecutive nice performances in a row . While var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's success is likely just the result of a mediocre player getting more minutes on a struggling team , pulling down var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds is impressive in any context . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will wrap up their road trip against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Wednesday .

They really turned it on in the second half , outscoring var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , 55 - 35 . A 28 - 8 run spanning between the third and fourth quarters was the decisive stretch , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had a 60 - 58 lead before that huge run . Both offenses struggled , with each team hitting just 40 percent of their shots . The assist - to - turnover ratio was the difference in the game , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] recording var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists to just var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] turnovers , while var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] committed var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers to var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had to play this game without var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and that was simply too much to overcome against an elite team like the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , as he tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][PF] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] got the start for var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] and finished with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FG3A] assists . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][REB] from the field to accrue var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][STL] steals .

The streak is now var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's career - best and the longest by any player since Michael Jordan in 1989 . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] recently became the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double heading into the month of December . Sunday 's performance marked var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's tenth triple - double in 21 games this season .

Despite var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] winning every quarter , this game was tight until the fourth quarter . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] in the final 12 minutes and made the scoreline look far worse than it actually was . Rebounding has been key for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] all season and that won them the game here , as the snatched down var_team[0][TEAM-REB] boards to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . The starters were a key as well , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's starters scored 75 points to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into this game with var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] injured and it clearly hampered them here . With no other legitimate point guard on the roster , the team had a hard time finding an offensive rhythm in a tough matchup .

He tallied 18 points , seven rebounds , five assists and two steals in the loss .

This is just var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] fourth game of the year after suffering a torn Achilles last season and he was spectacular , scoring var_player[0][6][PTS] points and dishing out seven assists in just var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . It will be interesting to see what Stan Van Gundy does with this rotation with the breakout play of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and the resurgence of var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] . All five starters scored in double - figures here , despite having their minutes limited in the blowout . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] also put in a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point double - double and would have approached yet another 20 - 20 game if this fixture did n't get so out of hand late . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be on the road on Wednesday against the Boston Celtics .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received a standout performance from var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied a season - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points , as well as double - digit scoring efforts from var_player[0][4][DREB] other members of the first unit , and a double - digit assist performance from the var_player[0][3][REB] member of the group who did n't get there , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . Meanwhile , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] received the lights - out production they are used to seeing from var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , while the rest of the starters struggled to maintain consistency through var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] quarters . The imbalance partially led to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] progressively losing steam after winning the first period by a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 23 margin , and despite a third - quarter resurgence , they produced only var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points in the 12 minutes to fall short . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] ' final line consisted of var_player[1][1][FG3_PCT] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists , var_player[1][1][STL] steals and a block . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the next closest in terms of usage and scoring , tallying var_player[1][0][PTS] points but adding only var_player[1][0][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[1][0][FG3M] assists and a steal . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other member of the starters to log double - digit scoring , supplying var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][DREB] shooting , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][2][PF] points but added var_player[1][2][REB] boards , an assist and a steal . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] helped make up for some of var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's shortfall with a var_player[1][9][PTS] points off the bench , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with a var_player[1][6][PTS] - point tally . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] complemented his team - high scoring haul with an assist and a rebound . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued his recent stretch of solid play with var_player[0][1][FG3_PCT] points , var_player[1][1][FG3A] boards and a block while frequently dealing with var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] down low . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] registered a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][FGA] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[0][0][PF] assists , a steal and a block . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] came within a rebound of also accomplishing the feat , managing var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] boards , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][PF] steals . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] collected var_player[0][4][PTS] points but added the aforementioned var_player[0][4][AST] dimes and hauled in var_player[0][4][REB] boards . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with var_player[0][5][PTS] points and also had var_player[0][5][FG3M] rebounds . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] now heads to the Midwest for a showdown with the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] await the Washington Wizards for a Saturday night tussle .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Phillips Arena on Friday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) endured their share of offensive struggles in the early going of the season , including a recent stretch where they failed to hit the 100 - point mark in four of six contests . However , they 've certainly gotten the hot hand over the last three contests , posting 112 points three games ago and a pair of 121 - point tallies in the two subsequent games . They were at it again Friday against a normally stingy var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defense , reaching the 121 - point milestone for a third straight outing while being led by var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] . The talented two - guard posted 23 points , which included a 5 - of - 8 mark from beyond the arc , along with eight rebounds and a steal . The four other members of the starting five also got into double digits in the scoring column , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] managed impressive success rates of var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the field and three - point range , respectively . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] followed KCP 's output with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] boards , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][BLK] blocks . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] supplied a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][PTS] - rebound double - double that also featured var_player[1][2][FTM] assists , a steal and a block . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] collected var_player[1][1][FGA] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FG3M] assists , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] registered an var_player[1][4][PTS] - point , var_player[1][4][AST] - assist double - double that included var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] continued his strong work off the bench with a near double - double of his own , totaling var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][5][FTM] assists and a steal . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] also contributed a pair of var_player[1][7][PTS] - point efforts in a reserve role . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only member of the starting five for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) to manage double - digit scoring , posting var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and a pair of rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] totaled only 14 points between them , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was in the starting lineup again with var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] sitting out with a hip injury , but he was only able to supply var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was particularly ineffective , totaling only var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][TO] blocks over var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . The second unit saw some more run than usual due to the blowout loss , and three bench players got into double digits in the scoring column . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] 's and var_player[0][7][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] 's pair of var_player[0][5][PTS] - point efforts led the way , while var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] followed closely behind with var_player[0][8][PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] return home to face the Orlando Magic on Sunday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head north of the border to face the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] dominated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , on Friday night at TD Garden . It was a physical game right from the start , which worked out in favor of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was ejected from the game in the second quarter for arguing a foul call after a tussle between him and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was huge for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) as he led the way offensively with var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting , in only var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][4][REB] - of - var_player[1][6][REB] from deep , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were great from downtown overall , hitting 11 - of - 27 . They shot only 39 percent from the field overall but made up for it with vicious defense , forcing var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was solid in his second game back , with var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][PF] assists , in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] both filled the stat sheet . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] assists , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][OREB] steals , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] notched var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][3][PF] assists and var_player[0][3][FTM] steals . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] move to 3 - 1 at home and will head out for a two - game road trip beginning in Indiana on Saturday . With this loss the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) fall to 1 - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] on the road and have not achieved consecutive wins once yet this season . They were coming off a good win in Brooklyn but failed to carry that momentum into this var_player[1][0][FG3M] , which may have had something to do with the fact that var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was ejected mid - second quarter . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][0][MIN] points in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes before losing his temper . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the high - point man with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , along with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][OREB] blocks , in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FTM] rebounds , while the only other player to tally double - digits for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , with var_player[1][4][FGA] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] can only look ahead , where they have to bring their best effort to Toronto for their second game in as many nights Saturday .
var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] dominated the box score in the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] overtime win against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Sunday . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][STL] steals on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting across var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][12][FIRST_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds , while var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][2][PTS] points and hauled in var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds .

As for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] Walkers scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points and added var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][3][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[1][3][DREB] boards and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from behind the arc , but even var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's heroics at the end of the fourth quarter were not enough to come away with the win .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at FedEx Forum on Sunday . Typically , it 's var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] who spearheads the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' attack , frequently leading var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in both field - goal attempts and scoring . However , it was backcourt mate C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] who took the mantle Sunday , putting up more than double the shots of var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and leading all scorers with a season - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points . The third - year shooting guard added four rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block over a team - high 39 minutes . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] also drained half of his var_player[1][3][FG3A] three - point attempts on the afternoon , after having made the same amount in the last three games combined . Overall , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's solid shooting ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent marks from the field and three - point range , respectively ) and a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - point fourth quarter helped secure the team 's third road win in var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] tries . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] assists , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and a steal .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][2][REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were led by var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who went for var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][PF] assists and a steal . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][STL] steals and var_player[0][4][BLK] blocks . The veteran guard made only one of five three - point tries , but it was memorable , as it came at the buzzer to end the first half . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] boards and var_player[0][3][FTA] steals . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was typically productive off the bench , leading the reserves with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][7][FTM] assists . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] was solid in a reserve role as well , providing var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][FG3A] rebounds , an assist and a steal .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were a projected nine - point road favorite headed into this matchup and they showed why in this dominating win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] took a var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - point lead headed into the half , but really opened it up with a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - 17 third quarter . This was the rare wire - to - wire win , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] leading by as much as 28 points at times in their victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was clicking on all cylinders , as they shot over var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and held the Sixers to under 40 percent shooting . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also won the turnover battle , 19 - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] , and the rebounding battle , var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 48 . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) got to close up their unenvious circus road trip in this victory , as they finished it with a franchise - best 4 - 2 record . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] continued his sparkling play , as he dropped var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] also scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points , doing that on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] likely would have triple - doubled if he played the fourth quarter , as he finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in 25 minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be off until Wednesday , when they host the Los_Angeles Lakers for their next game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have been playing better recently , but this game was well out of hand early on . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , tallying var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds on var_player[0][1][DREB] - of - 9 shooting . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was the best bench player , accruing var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][5][BLK] assists and var_player[0][5][AST] blocks . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] also provided 14 points , var_player[0][8][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][8][BLK] blocks off the bench . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in his first start of the season .

Baskets by var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] put the Wolves up by var_player[0][0][FG3A] , but var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] responded with a pair of free throws on the other end to tie the game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] held a var_player[1][1][TO] - point advantage with 48 seconds to play , but a var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] jumper brought var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] back to within two , and two var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] free throws var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] seconds later knotted the game at 105 .

In a battle between two struggling teams , they left it all on the floor in this matchup . While there were only 12 ties and six lead changes , this game came down to the wire in an overtime thriller . Turnovers are what really killed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they committed var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] of them , while forcing just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . In addition , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] really struggled shooting , as they hit just var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent of their free - throws and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent of their three - pointers . The bench was also huge for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they outscored var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , 62 - 43 . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) almost never wins with var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] struggling , but they did just that here . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] still finished the game with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , but went just var_player[1][1][PF] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field .

Unfortunately for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , they were unable to have the same kind of shooting success Friday night , as they shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] . It was their free throw shooting that kept them in the game , as they went 23 - of - 30 from the charity stripe , but that ultimately was not enough .

Both var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had impressive showings . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][PF] - var_player[1][8][MIN] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][PF] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][4][AST] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists , while var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][REB] - var_player[1][0][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][4][FTM] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals . var_player[1][8][FIRST_NAME] has now posted 20 or more points in var_player[1][0][AST] straight games , a stretch where he 's averaging 23 points . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has put in two impressive performances in a row as well , combining for var_player[1][4][FG_PCT] points , var_player[1][4][FGA] assists and var_player[1][4][TO] steals during that span . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] did his part in the victory , going var_player[1][1][FGM] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field , but just var_player[1][1][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][1][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds to notch a double - double . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] posted a double - double off the bench as well , finishing with var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGA] - var_player[1][7][FGM] FG , var_player[1][7][FTM] - var_player[1][7][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][4][STL] of his best offensive performances since joining the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . He went 13 - for - 22 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 30 points , while also adding eight assists over 36 minutes . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] has struggled with his shot lately , combining to go 7 - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field over his var_player[0][4][PF] previous games , so it was a step in the right direction for the guard , who recorded a new season - high in points . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong day from the field as well . He finished with 19 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 3 - 5 FT ) , 10 rebounds and five steals . The five steals matched a season - high , while the double - double was his second of his last five games . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was hitting nearly all of his shots as well . He posted 16 points , while shooting 7 - of - 10 from the field and a perfect 2 - of - 2 from deep . The only other Buck in double figures was OJ var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] , who came off the bench for var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] FG , var_player[0][5][STL] - var_player[0][5][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][DREB] - var_player[0][5][REB] FT ) The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to New_York to play the Knicks on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at the Moda Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . At the end of the third quarter the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had established a 70 - 63 lead , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to come back and out - score the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] , pushing the game to overtime . In overtime the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to take control and finish off the victory in front of their home fans . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot only var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent , so that may have been the difference in this one . With var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] returning from an illness , he and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] re - established their offensive duo . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][4][FGM] assists , nearly recording a double - double . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] on the other hand shot really well , going var_player[0][1][FGM] - for - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the field to record var_player[0][1][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . Despite missing games , he picked up right where he left off and scored at least 23 points for the sixth straight game . Wes var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] continued to stay hot with his shot . He went 7 - for - 14 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from beyond the arc to score 19 points , while also adding six rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] were the other var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to reach double figures with var_player[0][0][PTS] and var_player[0][6][PTS] points respectively . With DeMar_DeRozan sidelined , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued to pick up the slack . He finished the game with 25 points ( 10 - 26 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) , seven rebounds and five assists , doing a little bit of everything for this team . Over his last three games , he 's now averaging a ridiculous 29 points as the clear offensive leader . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who 's filling in for DeRozan , had a decent game as well . He scored an efficient 14 points ( 7 - 11 FG ) and grabbed 11 rebounds , giving him his first double - double of the season . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was the biggest contributor off the bench . He went for 13 points and three rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][2][PTS] and var_player[1][3][PTS] points apiece . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Oakland to play the Golden_State Warriors on Friday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Saturday at the Moda Center by a score of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] led by as many as var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in the third quarter , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] began chipping into var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's lead later in the third , cutting the deficit to var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] closed the margin to six points late in the fourth quarter , but var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's lead proved insurmountable . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has become one of the hottest teams in the league , having won nine of its last ten games , including four straight . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot well from the field , sporting a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] field goal percentage . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] also got solid contributions from its bench players , highlighted by var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] 's double - double . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will wrap up their Western Conference road trip on Monday when they play the Clippers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had its four - game win streak snapped Saturday despite coming into the game on three days of rest . Big man var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] injured his right shoulder in the game and did not return . However , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had an excellent game with var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] play their next installment of a seven - game home stand on Monday when they host the Lakers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) held on to survive the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) by a score of var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Time Warner Cable Arena on Wednesday . With var_player[0][5][FGM] seconds remaining , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] made a nice move to get open on the inbounds and flipped the ball home to give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a var_player[0][5][FGM] - point lead . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] thought they had the win when rookie var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] Porzingus drained a desperation var_player[1][1][TO] - pointer with var_player[1][1][STL] seconds left , but the shot did n't count . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had a chance to win the game , but his shot bounced off the side of the backboard and went back to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] blew a 10 - point lead going into the fourth quarter . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with a game - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][TO] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][PF] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) and is slowly creeping his season average back to where he normally is at . Coach Derek_Fisher rolled with a deep lineup again as 12 var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] saw playing time . Despite the blown lead , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] played solid defense for most of the night - - particularly var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who shut down var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] . Porzingus had a game - high 15 rebounds to go along with 10 points for his fourth double - double of the season . Trailing by var_player[0][7][FGA] going into the final quarter , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] employed var_player[0][8][DREB] var_player[0][7][FIRST_NAME] 's - - var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] - - off the bench and the duo was able to drag var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] back into the game . var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] scored eight of his var_player[0][8][PTS] points in the fourth outplayed var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] for a second consecutive game . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , who finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][STL] - var_player[0][4][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTA] - var_player[0][4][FTM] FT ) , was a bit banged up during var_player[0][4][FG3M] of the final possessions of the game . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had the best night for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , posting a team - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][TO] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) while pulling down var_player[0][3][FG3A] rebounds over var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] host LeBron_James and the Cavaliers on Friday ; the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head to Chicago to take on the Bulls .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 120 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday . In a matchup of two of the best defenses in basketball , this was a high - scoring game . What may have ultimately killed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was a nine - minute stretch in the fourth quarter where they failed to make a basket . That stat is a bit flukey though , considering the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got to the free - throw line time after time in the final 12 minutes . This var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] team has struggled with assists all season long and that may have been the difference here , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] out - assisted the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] . The win makes the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] the 17th team in NBA history to start 120 to start a season . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were once again led by Steph var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , who tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in the win . He did however commit a season - high seven turnovers , but that 's a sign of him being more aggressive and getting that assist total up after its been down all year . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also got a var_player[0][3][PTS] - point first half from var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , but he failed to score a point in the second half . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot an impressive var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , but did commit var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers in the win . It was n't the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] cleanest performance , but a win is a win . They 'll look to stay undefeated when they play the Los_Angeles Clippers on Thursday in a big rivalry game . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] left it all on the floor against the defending champs , but just could n't pull it out late . Ten of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] fourth quarter points came from the free - throw line and they simply did n't make enough shots down the stretch to get the win in this game . They were once again led by their guards though , as var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] all had nice games . The three actually combined for 69 points , 16 rebounds , 15 assists and four steals in the loss . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] also got var_player[0][4][FTM] steals from var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who continued to read Steph var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's passes all evening long . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have now lost var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] of their last var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] games with the only two wins coming against the Philadelphia 76ers and New_Orleans Pelicans , who have a combined 1 - 21 record . They 'll have a tough task on Wednesday , as they have to travel to Utah to take on the defensively - sound Jazz in the second half of a back - to - back set .
In a close contest , the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) earned a much - needed var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] win against the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . With their playoff hopes starting to wane , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will need a solid end to its season in order to achieve postseason berth . Still a game behind their rival Indiana Pacers , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have spent weeks on the outside of the playoff picture looking in . Thursday 's win may keep the team 's playoff hopes alive , as the squad was able to scrape by against the similarly - situated var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . All-Star var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] took control for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , racking up var_player[1][3][PTS] points to go with var_player[1][3][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . Bench big man var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , exploded for var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points in what proved to be a valuable contribution to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's winning effort . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's stellar var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field was a key factor in establishing a lead at the game 's end . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , sits just half a game out of playoff contention despite the loss . After making last year 's Western Conference Finals , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have seen a tremendous drop - off , now sitting below .500 . On Thursday , the backcourt of var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] Beverly and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 46 points . Beverly also notched seven assists without a single turnover in one of his biggest performances of the season . It was n't enough for the win , however , as the team shot a dismal 40 percent from the field as a whole . With the season entering its final stretch , it will take some winning basketball to get var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] back on track for the playoffs . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will play the Pistons on Sunday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Thunder on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 10 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at American Airlines Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . In the first LeBron-less regular season game for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , they were able to pull out an 11 - point victory over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The oft - injured var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had to go to the locker room with a left calf contusion , but he was able to return later in the game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had three players score over var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points in the victory . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who started for the suspended var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][1][PTS] points , going var_player[1][1][FGM] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field . He pulled down five rebounds and added an assist . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] played var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes and had var_player[1][2][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][2][FGM] rebounds and a blocked shot . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished with a double - double , scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] also finished in double - digits with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , while recording var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and a steal . As expected , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] took the lead for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] had his first double - double of the season , going for var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FG3M] - var_player[0][2][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . He also had four assists , a steal , and a blocked shot . Despite leaving the game for a small period of time , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] was still able to finsh with var_player[0][3][PTS] points as he shot var_player[0][3][FG_PCT] percent from the field ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG ) and also collected var_player[0][3][DREB] rebound , var_player[0][3][FTM] assists , and steal . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] surprised var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fans after he took the starting point guard position from last years ' starter var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] put up var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , and var_player[0][4][FG3M] turnovers . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] made his regular season debut with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will play on the road against the Orlando Magic on Thursday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will play the Philidelphia 76ers Saturday in Philidelphia .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) got the job done on the road against the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this one looking to grab a much - needed win , and they did just that . It was n't easy , but thanks to some solid guard play , they left var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with a win . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( back ) returned from a var_player[1][3][DREB] - game absence , leading the way with var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][AST] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FTM] FT ) , var_player[1][3][FGM] assists , var_player[1][3][FTM] rebounds and var_player[1][3][OREB] steal in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] once again excelled in his role off the bench , scoring var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][FG3M] - var_player[1][7][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][7][FTM] - var_player[1][7][FTA] FT ) to go with var_player[1][7][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][7][DREB] rebounds . In total , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had var_player[1][8][FGM] players score in double figures , with var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] posting var_player[1][8][PTS] off the bench , and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scoring var_player[1][4][FGA] points in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] outscored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] in the fourth quarter , which ended up being the difference . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are searching for answers right now , and with trade rumors flying about var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , he put up another mediocre game . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] scored just var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FTM] FT ) to go with var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists in only var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . It was the combo of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds ) and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists ) that led the way , but they still fell short . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was playing through a broken nose , and earns the all - effort award for playing var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes , scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] points and bringing in var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds while fighting through the discomfort .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , in double - overtime at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday . These are two teams that have struggled offensively all season , so a numbers boosting double - overtime game may be what they need to find some momentum . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] were the ones who escaped with the win , as they won the second overtime , 18 - 12 . Shooting was key for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as they shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and from three - point range . Both teams struggled at the free - throw line , as they each failed to crack 70 percent shooting . There were 10 ties and 27 lead changes in total , with neither team leading by more than 12 points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have n't had much to get excited about this season , but a double - overtime road win may be just what they need to get going . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's best player , as he totaled var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds off the bench . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] matched his var_player[1][3][PTS] points and added var_player[1][3][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][3][PF] assists to his tally in the victory . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] accumulated var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to collect var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][FTM] assists . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will return to action on Thursday in a road matchup with the New_York Knicks . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) continue to play well , but they simply ca n't win games . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] did all he could though , as he had game - highs with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][PF] blocks in the defeat . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was fantastic off the bench , accruing a career - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[0][5][FG3M] assists and var_player[0][5][AST] steals before fouling out in overtime . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] went just var_player[0][4][FTA] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field , but tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists before fouling out himself . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] was also productive off the bench , providing var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][FG3A] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be on Thursday , when they host the Los_Angeles Lakers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't need much beyond var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] on Wednesday to beat the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The duo combined for 72 points on 27 - for - 42 shooting , while the rest of the starting five could only muster a 30 percent success rate ( 7 - for - 23 ) from the field . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's 2016 first - round pick , pitched in var_player[0][1][REB] boards while starting at power forward , but var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other player to manage double - digit scoring ( var_player[0][4][PTS] points ) . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was often overmatched by var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and collected a modest var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had a similarly unbalanced box score , as var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 55 of the team 's var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] points while shooting var_player[1][0][PTS] - for - var_player[1][1][FG_PCT] from the field . Meanwhile , their starting backcourt of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] went cold , supplying a combined var_player[1][4][FGA] points on 5 - for - 19 shooting .
The Cavs lost var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( shoulder ) and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( shoulder ) within the game but scored the victory on the strength of Lebron var_player[0][10][FIRST_NAME] ' var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][FTA] - rebound double - double . Defense was also a key , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] committed var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers and shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long distance . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] followed var_player[0][10][FIRST_NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points over var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes before departing . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds over var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes in his return from a 13 - game absence due to a knee injury . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes , and J.R. var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] , getting extra run due to var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's early shower , led the bench with var_player[0][5][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] turned in matching var_player[1][3][FGA] - point efforts . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a modest var_player[1][4][PTS] points .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention , this still marked a hard fought game between these Western Conference rivals . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came out as the superior shooters in this one , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . Also helping push the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to a win was their rebounding , as they finished with a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] advantage . With DeMarcus_Cousins sidelined because of a foot injury , it was var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] who really stepped up and had huge games . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists , while var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][DREB] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][1][TO] FT ) and var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] had far - and - away his best performance of the season , as he 's really picked it up lately . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 20 points , while shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , is on fire as well , combining to go 19 - of - 35 from the field and var_player[0][1][DREB] - for - 6 from deep for 57 points over his last var_player[0][1][FG3M] outings . He 's now pushed his season averages to 21 points and 6 rebounds per game on the season . Coming off the bench , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong showing as well . He went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 18 points , while adding eight rebounds over 31 minutes as well . The 18 points matched a season - high for the forward , as it was one of his better outings of the year . Despite being unable to limit the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' offense , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] nearly pulled off the victory due to some strong offensive performances of their own . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had the most impressive line , finishing with var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][AST] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[1][3][FTM] assists . It was a season - high in field goal attempts for the guard , who had a slightly better performance than he did on Friday , where he went just 3 - of - 12 from the field . He 's now averaging 20 points on the season and will continue to get off a ton of shots due to the vast amount of injuries the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are dealing with . Rookie var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had a big game as well though , recording var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . He 's posted 20 points or more in seven of his last var_player[1][3][AST] games , as he 's done his best to help var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] pick up the slack of those sitting out . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the other big contributor . In 40 minutes , he finished with 21 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and 11 assists , marking just the second double - double of his career . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Portland to take on the Trail_Blazers on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 61 - 22 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( 38 - 45 ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at Philips Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] in their first matchup of the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs . After coming out of the first quarter with a 12 - point lead , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] looked as if they were about to run the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] right out of the gym and coast to an easy victory . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had something to say about that though , as they eventually went on a nine - point run with eight minutes left in the third quarter to bring it back within three . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] then went on a run of their own , regaining a solid lead over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] brought it to within four points again with just under two minutes left in the final quarter , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] proved to be just too much and held on to a seven - point victory despite a strong effort from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] percent from deep . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had his shot locked in Sunday , helping to be the spark that the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] needed to overcome a strong push from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] had hit at least var_player[0][3][AST] three - pointers in var_player[0][3][AST] of his last var_player[0][3][FTM] games coming into the playoffs , so it was n't surprising to see him light it up from deep again Sunday . Both var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] were essential in the win as well though . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][OREB] - var_player[0][4][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FTM] FT ) , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , while var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FG3A] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FG3M] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][PF] - var_player[0][4][TO] FT ) , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and a steal . With var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] shooting so well , it really opened up the court for var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , who was able to drive the ball with plenty of success . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received a solid contribution from var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] off their bench as well . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] was able to give var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] a few breaks , while also producing var_player[0][7][PTS] points ( var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][STL] - var_player[0][7][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][7][FTA] - var_player[0][7][PF] FT ) and var_player[0][7][PF] assists over var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to keep it close due to the performances from both var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] was harassed by the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' crowd in his return to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , but was able to overcome it with var_player[1][0][FGA] points ( var_player[1][0][FG3A] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][0][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FGM] assists . He was n't able to have very much success with his three - point shot , but he was able to do a little bit of everything else for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , recorded var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][OREB] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FGM] FT ) of his own , to go along with var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][STL] steals . His var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] rebounds helped var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] secure a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] rebounding advantage over the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , while the double - double was his second over his last four games . Also notching a double - double was var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][1][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][FG3A] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists over 39 minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt had plenty of success against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' defense , but they 'll need to do even more if they want to have a chance in this series . Both var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] finished in double figures as well . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][AST] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds , while var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FTM] - var_player[1][6][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . These two teams will play again on Wednesday in the second game of a best - of - seven series .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] brought var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] off the bench for his first var_player[1][4][FG3M] games but moved him into the starting lineup at point guard Saturday . He finished with 12 points , six rebounds and five assists in 23 minutes . Seven players scored in double figures for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , with var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] scoring a team - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Chicago Bulls on Monday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had their three - game win streak come to an end with the loss . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] started a second straight game with var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] coming off the bench , and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench for a third straight game behind var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] as coach Lionel Hollins continues to play the guys he thinks are getting the job done instead of just lining up his var_player[0][4][TO] most expensive contracts against other teams . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and gave away 19 easy points on var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , digging holes they could n't climb out of . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will host the Sacramento Kings on Monday .
var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] have been doing special things on offense this season , but their var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] points in this win marks a season - high . They did that damage by hitting 56 percent of their shots and going 36 - of - 43 from the free - throw line . In addition , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] dominated the rebounding and assisting differentials on their way to an easy win . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added another triple - double to his tally , as he led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][FGM] assists on var_player[0][4][AST] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to drop a career - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points on var_player[0][5][FGM] - of - var_player[0][5][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] accumulated var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] did all he could , as he led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][AST] assists off the bench . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] played motivated in his homecoming game , totaling var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds on var_player[1][2][DREB] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting ..

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) was red - hot coming in to Saturday 's contest and seemed primed to continue their streak , considering they were facing a Sixers team that had dropped four of their last five games and would be without their most potent offensive weapon in var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( knee ) . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] made good on that prognosis , ambushing their vistors by a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - 17 margin in the first quarter and never really letting up . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with a monstrous var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included a trio of blocks , and the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] bench totaled 50 points overall .

The Sixers head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Monday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Monday evening as well .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Philips Arena on Saturday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came in to Saturday riding high off a surprise home victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday evening , but they were a markedly different team on the second night of the back - to - back set . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) stymied var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to the tune of a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the floor , and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range .

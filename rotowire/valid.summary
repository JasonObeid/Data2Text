In fact , they combined to go 2 - for - 22 from three - point range in the loss .

It was a season - high in points for him , and a nice surprise for the Sixers after averaging only 9 points per game up until this point in the season . There was also some solid contributions off the bench from var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FTM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][FG3M] - var_player[1][5][REB] 3Pt , var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][7][BLK] rebounds , while var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][REB] - var_player[1][7][FTA] FG , var_player[1][5][DREB] - var_player[1][5][PF] 3Pt , var_player[1][5][FTA] - var_player[1][7][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][7][FTA] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were back to full strength Wednesday after the return of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( rest ) , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_player[0][2][FGM] ) were not , as head coach Tyronn Lue elected to rest his big var_player[0][2][FG3M] of var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and Kyrie_Irving . Without them , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as expected , had a tough time getting anything going on offense and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] took advantage . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] seized control of the game from the very start and never let up , led by their big man in the middle var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] , who posted a double - double of var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . However , the biggest performance of the night came unexpectedly off the bench from var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored an efficient var_player[0][7][PTS] points in just var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes . As a team , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field but were on fire from long range , hitting 12 of their 23 shots from behind the arc .

Thursday marked the sixth game this season that var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] played as a reserve , and it was yet another great performance off the bench for the 6 - foot - var_player[0][5][FG3A] forward . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] recorded a game - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points in Thursday 's victory over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , and with that , he is now averaging var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points per game over his six as a reserve this year . On top of that , he 's also been doing work on the glass , as while he managed to record just two rebounds Thursday , he is still averaging 7 per game off the bench . And with var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] ' move to the bench , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] has been thrust into the starting lineup and has matched his production as a reserve , with the big man out of Wisconsin averaging 11 points on var_player[0][1][FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field as a starter after averaging 11 points per game in his former role off the bench .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had just three wins in their previous 12 games , so this road victory may be what they need to get back to .500 . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the player of the game , as he accumulated var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][TO] rebounds , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][STL] steals . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in scoring , as he dropped var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] from the field to total var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] collected var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , falling just shy of a triple - double . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came into this game extremely hot , but this was a baffling loss against a struggling var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] team . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team , providing var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds off the bench . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] steals , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][FTA] assists .

In the var_player[1][0][FTA] games since var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] went down with a season - ending ACL injury , coach Jason Kidd has cut the umbilical cord they had on var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] . He played over 37 minutes for the second straight game Saturday , which is ten more minutes than his season average of 27 minutes per game . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] returned to the starting lineup after sitting out Thursday 's game on a league mandated var_player[1][2][STL] - game suspension .

No player scored more than 18 points in the loss with the five starters combining for 18 turnovers . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][PF] steals look good , but considering he shot var_player[1][3][REB] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] and committed var_player[1][3][TO] turnovers , it was actually very ugly . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] gave the team a nice spark off the bench , as he scored var_player[1][5][PTS] points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will have a few days off until they play the Boston Celtics on Monday in their next game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has been playing their best defense of the season in recent weeks and it came to a head here . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] were incredible down low , as they combined for 23 rebounds , var_player[0][2][FGA] steals and var_player[0][2][REB] blocks in the win . var_player[0][3][FIRST_NAME] hood led the team with var_player[0][3][PTS] points and also got var_player[0][3][STL] steals of his own . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are now allowing 85 points a game across their last seven games , which is tops in the NBA . On deck for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is a game against the Phoenix Suns on Saturday in a back - to - back set .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , in Game var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] of the Western Conference Finals . Shooting mastermind , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] dropped a legendary performance on the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][4][PTS] points in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . He hit seven of his nine attempts from beyond the arc and also filled up the stat sheet with seven assists , five rebounds , two steals and one block . It certainly did n't hurt that var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up his game against var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who has been somewhat hobbled by a knee injury . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][2][REB] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and a block in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes of action , before fouling out . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] put it on the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] early and often . They led by 25 at halftime and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was unable to mount any sort of comeback . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a force to be reckoned with and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had no answer for him and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][1][PTS] points of his own to go along with a team - high var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] laid a dud at home in Game var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and have now put themselves in a situation where they would need to win four straight games to advance to the NBA Finals . A feat that no team has ever accomplished after losing the first three games of the series . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] could n't find the magic that helped him finish second in the regular - season MVP award voting . He did a great job getting to the line as he usually does , going 10 - for - 11 from the charity stripe . However , he went just 3 - for - 16 from the field and could n't find his mojo . If the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] want to be the 2004 Red Sox of the NBA , they will need immaculate performances from their key players for four straight games . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has n't lost var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - straight games all season long , let alone four . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will host the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in Game 4 on Monday .
var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] has been scoring at will this season and he added yet another var_player[1][3][PTS] - point outing to his tally . He has now scored 30 or more points in 10 - of - 12 games this season and is only the fifth player in the past 54 years to set that mark . Strangely , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] won many of the statistical categories , as they took the rebounding , assisting , shooting percentage , points off turnovers and free - trow shooting battles in their defeat . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][4][STL] of his best games of the season though , as he tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] continues to dominate off the bench , as his var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds add to his averages of 24 points and var_player[0][5][FGM] rebounds over his last var_player[0][5][FG3M] games . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] had a strange line , as he scored var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][TO] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting . It was his 13 - of - 13 night from the free - throw line that got him up to that total , as he went 0 - of - 5 from long distance .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) rolled over the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday night . In a game that was a major mismatch on paper , there was n't much fight from the big underdog . The starters for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dominated in the first and third quarters , as they outscored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 67 - 38 in that var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - minute stretch . Usually the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] win by outscoring teams , but they played some of their best defense of the season here . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long distance . This game was well out of hand early and mismatches like this are ugly to watch for NBA fans . Not many teams can keep up with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and especially not the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] blitzed them in the first quarter and then hit them even harder coming out after the half time . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the star of the show , as he scored var_player[1][3][FGA] first quarter points and finished the game with var_player[1][3][PTS] in total . Steph var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] had to leave this game in the third quarter after re - aggravating his shin injury and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fans have to be concerned at this point with hs continuous distress . After getting three - straight triple - doubles , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a subpar outing , by scoring just var_player[1][1][PTS] points while grabbing var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in the win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has a few days off until they play the Portland Trail_Blazers on Friday in their next game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came into this game with a miraculous three - game winning streak , but left with a blowout loss in an expected scenario . Considering the spread was at 15 points coming in , the final scoreline does n't look as bad . Only one var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] player scored more than 11 points , as everyone struggled to find their shot . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only bright spot , as he scored a team - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points in just var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes of action . They did have to play this game without Kobe_Bryant and D'Angelo_Russell , but the result likely would have been the same even if those two played . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to bounce back in their next game against the surging Sacramento Kings on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . While the game went into halftime tied 54 - 54 , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came out firing in the third quarter , out - scoring the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] and allowing themselves to coast to a var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - point victory at home in front of their crowd . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . With their fantastic shooting and rebounding advantage , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] grabbed their fourth straight victory . The biggest contributor for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] surprisingly came off the bench in Wednesday 's matchup , as Louis var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] finished with a team - high of var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][PTS] - var_player[1][7][MIN] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][FTM] - var_player[0][5][FTA] FT ) , while also adding var_player[1][7][FTM] assists and var_player[1][7][FGA] steals in only var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . It was a very nice surprise for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as he 's only averaging var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] points per game so far this season . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] shot well , going var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][REB] - for - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while also recording var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . He 's really struggled with his shot this season , so it was good to see him turn it around Wednesday . Coming just short of a double - double , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTA] - var_player[0][2][PF] FT ) and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . He 's now averaging 13 points and 9 rebounds on the season . Neither var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] or var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] had too big of a night , but each still finished in double figures . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][REB] - var_player[0][0][PTS] FG , var_player[0][0][TO] - var_player[0][0][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][OREB] - var_player[0][0][FG3M] FT ) and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , while var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][PTS] FG , var_player[0][4][STL] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who recorded var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][DREB] - var_player[1][0][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . Despite Friday 's var_player[1][0][STL] point outing where he played only 13 minutes , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] has now scored var_player[1][0][PTS] points or more in his last var_player[1][0][FTM] games . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][3][TO] - for - var_player[1][3][FGM] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][3][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds . It was the most points he 's scored since mid - December , so it was good to see him dial in his shot Wednesday . Having var_player[1][2][OREB] of his least productive games in awhile , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with only var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][DREB] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][2][PF] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocked shots . He matched a season - high of nine turnovers as well , so he 'll need to cut those down if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] want a chance at winning in the future . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Friday .

The Cavs shot 51 percent from the field and 45 percent from three - point range . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] countered with a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points on the strength of var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] III followed with var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] compiled var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][0][PTS] and var_player[0][1][PTS] points , respectively , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] posted a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the floor .

The advantage would remain steady throughout the game , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] never led in the second half . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , now winners of var_player[1][0][FTA] straight , was led by var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][AST] assists from var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][7][FIRST_NAME] has been maligned for his shooting of late , but he 's compiled 35 assists over his last var_player[1][7][FGA] contests . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] added a var_player[1][4][PTS] - point , var_player[1][1][DREB] - rebound double - double , and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][TO] night after putting up 37 at Madison Square Garden against the Knicks . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] also added var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] may have been the most important difference - maker for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , finishing with var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds off the bench . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] struggled shooting the ball throughout the night , finishing a hair under var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent as a team . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists , while var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had his best offensive performance of the season , putting up var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][FGM] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) generated a renewed sense of optimism with the hiring of the legendary Magic Johnson to the President of Basketball Operations post at the All-Star break , but the harsh reality of an upstart squad has manifested itself since then . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has now lost all three games of the Magic era following Sunday 's defeat , which saw them get dominated in all phases . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range , while also eliciting 18 turnovers from their over - matched hosts . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][OREB] assist . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] boards and var_player[1][1][AST] assist . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to tally var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][7][FTM] steal and var_player[1][7][FTA] block . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] continued to run with the first unit , supplying var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][AST] assists and var_player[1][2][PF] steal . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] generated a near double - double with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with matching var_player[1][5][PTS] - point efforts . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with a career - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][FTM] block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up with a bench - leading var_player[0][5][PTS] points , along with var_player[0][5][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][5][TO] assists . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was right behind him with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] boards , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][PF] steal . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] totaled a modest var_player[0][1][FTA] points but he also hauled in var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and dished out var_player[0][1][AST] dimes . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] turned in strong work off the bench with var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][9][OREB] steals .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) did well to grind out the win as they faced the fourth game of their current five - game road trip . Despite coming off a monumental 142 - 106 loss in Golden_State on Monday , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bounced back to earn their third road win of the season . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the high - point man for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FTM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting and var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FTA] from the foul line . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] also added var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][PF] steals to round out his stat line . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] gave the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] a boost early and finished the game with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , while going var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] from the field . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[1][4][OREB] - of - var_player[1][4][DREB] from long range but finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists .

They drop to 3 - 6 at home with this loss , which also marks their seventh loss in their last ten games . Despite being back at full strength after a few injuries early in the season , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have yet to pull it together . They had six players score in double digits but no one with more than 15 points as they fell short at home on a night when they needed to take advantage of a travel - worn opponent . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce back as they take on the Lakers in Los_Angeles on Friday .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] may only have var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] wins on their lowly season , but recently acquired point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] has provided a spark in the backcourt for the NBA 's last place team .

var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] is having by far the most productive season of his career so far , making this cold stretch he has been on over his last var_player[1][4][FG3A] games even more uncharacteristic . His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all , with var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] shooting just var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] while still managing to come up with var_player[1][4][PTS] points thanks to some good free throw shooting . But this is starting to become a trend , as var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has shot 13 - of - 47 ( 28 percent ) from the field over his last var_player[1][4][FG3A] contests . Despite those horrific shooting numbers , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has still managed to average var_player[1][4][PTS] points per game over that stretch , but that is only because of his ability to get to the line . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has shot 31 - of - 35 ( 89 percent ) from the charity stripe in those var_player[1][4][FG3A] games , effectively covering up how much the point guard has really struggled as of late .

The big story for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] has been the absence of forward Blake_Griffin , who is out at least two weeks with a quad injury . The thing is , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] does n't seem to be missing Griffin that much after a third straight win - - second with Griffin sidelined . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] jumped out to a commanding lead in the first quarter behind var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with a team - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . Center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] also stepped up big with Griffin out , pouring in var_player[1][2][PTS] points with var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , though var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] lost the battle on the boards 45 to var_team[1][TEAM-REB] .

He came off the bench to score 21 points on var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][DREB] shooting and var_player[1][1][FG3A] treys to provide some extra scoring punch behind var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] .

var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's 14 points per game this season is his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA , but the big man affects the game in so many different ways beyond scoring , most of which do n't even show up in the box score .

They 'd be held scoreless the rest of the way , however , losing for the second time in a row after falling to the Trail_Blazers in overtime Wednesday night . Aside from the mini - run in the third quarter , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was kept in check , finishing with only var_player[0][4][PTS] points in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] paced var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][AST] rebounds , while var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][3][PTS] points , including var_player[0][1][DREB] three - pointers . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][9][PTS] points and var_player[0][9][REB] rebounds off the bench in var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points from var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who made var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][5][FGA] field goal attempts . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , and J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were still without Blake_Griffin ( elbow ) and Jamal_Crawford ( calf ) . Both players are expected to return in the near future , though each remains out indefinitely . Up next , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] returns home to host the Timberwolves on Monday night . The West-leading var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] take on the Suns in Phoenix , also on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite finishing with just a six - point victory , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were much better with their shooting percentages . They went 51 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . What really kept the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in this game was their ability to force the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] into turnovers , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers compared to just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . This was a big win for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they continue to trail the Thunder for the final projected playoff spot in the Western Conference standings . Seemingly coming out of nowhere , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was a huge reason the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to grab a win , despite missing both var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] . He went 9 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to finish with a game - high of 25 points , to go along with five rebounds . It was a new season - high for var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] in just his fourth start of the year , as it was his first time breaking the 20 - point mark . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also had a strong showing , posting var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][STL] - var_player[0][4][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][DREB] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][BLK] blocked shots . It was his third double - double over his last four games , a stretch where he 's averaged 14 points and 10 assists . As long as var_player[0][9][SECOND_NAME] is out , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] should continue to be the go - to player on offense . Notching a double - double of his own , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTA] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . He 's combined for 26 points and 24 rebounds over his last two games . Both var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures in points off the bench , with var_player[0][6][PTS] and var_player[0][7][PTS] points respectively . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] saw their most production from var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who went var_player[1][1][DREB] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][1][TO] - for - var_player[1][1][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while adding var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds as well . He 's played well of late , averaging 19 points and eight rebounds over his last three games . A big reason for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] keeping this game close was their bench though , who combined to score 49 of the teams var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] points . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was var_player[1][7][FG3A] of those players , as he went off for var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][FG3A] - var_player[1][7][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][7][PF] - var_player[1][7][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds . Over his last two outings with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , he 's combined for 34 points and 10 rebounds , as he looks to be getting more and more comfortable with his new team . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] were the other var_player[1][5][PF] bench contributors . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][REB] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FG3M] - var_player[1][6][FG3M] FT ) , var_player[1][5][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][6][FTM] blocked shots , while var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FTA] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FTA] - var_player[1][6][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][6][REB] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) earned a home win Sunday over the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) at TD Garden , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] scored the game 's first four points , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] immediately rattled off a 90 run to take a lead they never relinquished . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] scored var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in a frantic first quarter and was brilliant offensively all day , as they shot a sharp var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and 55 percent from three . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's starting backcourt powered the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] offense , as var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3PT ) and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG ) added var_player[0][4][PTS] . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][PTS] points ) and var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][REB] - var_player[0][9][FGA] FG , var_player[0][9][PTS] points ) gave var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] an efficient inside attack as well . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with a game - high var_player[1][1][PTS] points and added var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FG3A] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points and dished var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][AST] behind sharp var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting from the field . But the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had no defensive answer for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and their brilliant shooting night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will take to the road for a matchup Tuesday in Milwaukee . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's road trip continues Monday against Cleveland .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday . The Cavs likely got more than they bargained for from a game Sixers squad that played them tough through all four quarters . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's collective defensive effort may have been the most surprising aspect of the game overall , as they managed to hold a hot var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] offense to a mediocre var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting performance from the field , and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . To provide some more tangible perspective on the noteworthiness of the Sixers ' effort , one has to realize the Cavs had tallied 53 and 48 percent figures , respectively , in those same categories against the Timberwolves in their most recent contest , and had also scored over 120 points in their two previous games . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to pull out the hard - fought victory on the back of var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who turned in a var_player[1][0][MIN] - point , var_player[1][0][REB] - rebound , var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - assist effort that also included a pair of steals . The other starters ' scoring contributions paled in comparison , as var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the next closest with var_player[1][1][REB] points . However , var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] was outstanding on the glass against a vulnerable var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] frontcourt , hauling in var_player[1][1][PTS] rebounds and adding var_player[1][1][FTA] assists and var_player[1][1][STL] steals . J.R. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and a steal , and drained another var_player[1][3][FG3M] three - pointers in the process . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had his own double - double in another start at center , collecting var_player[1][2][REB] points and grabbing var_player[1][2][REB] boards . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had a second consecutive quiet game , notching var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][PF] assists , var_player[1][4][PF] steals and a block over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . Although his contributions in non - scoring categories were certainly solid , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] notably struggled from the field , draining only var_player[1][4][FGM] of var_player[1][4][FGA] shot attempts . The Cavs improved to 26 - 9 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks on Tuesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's valiant effort was spearheaded by var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][2][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] put together a second straight strong performance after a string of relatively quiet games , tallying a double - double with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . He also added seven boards and a steal . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] could only put together a pair of var_player[0][3][PTS] - point outings , while var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the Philadephia bench with var_player[0][0][REB] points and var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds . The Sixers fell to 4 - 36 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They await the Chicago Bulls for a Thursday matchup .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into Saturday 's matchup as part of the second game of a back - to - back , and utilized the 3 - point shot to make up for defensive breakdowns early in the game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was without Blake_Griffin ( quad ) , who is amongst the league 's best with 23 points per game and var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds per game , but that did not stop var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] from running the pick and roll at an efficient rate . Add that to J.J. Reddick and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] 's sharp shooting from deep and the equation resulted in a second straight win . Reddick led all var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' with 25 points on 5 - of - 7 3 - point shooting , including a streak of three straight deep balls on consecutive possessions in the second half . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was equally impressive , finishing with var_player[1][5][PTS] points on var_player[1][5][REB] - of - var_player[1][5][FG3A] behind the arc . Pure point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] completed another double - double , with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . The first half defensive inefficiencies need to be addressed by the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , but the team shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep as a unit , which made up for the slow , turnover ridden start . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will continue their road trip and face the Washington Wizards ( 14 - 14 ) on Monday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] stormed out to a strong 1st quarter , but were unable to capitalize on the momentum going forward . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][DREB] assists on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting . The backcourt duo of var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who currently combine for the best scoring bench duo in the league , thrived in the first half before going cold later in the latter quarters . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][6][PTS] points on a perfect var_player[0][6][FGM] - of - var_player[0][6][FGM] shooting in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes , while Michigan product var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] , added var_player[0][7][PTS] points in the same amount of time . Rudy_Gobert ( knee ) continues to miss games with a knee injury , and the absence of their shot blocking big man has caused the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to run a small lineup . The lack of size and rim protection allowed var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] to take advantage for the inopportune , easy basket . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's biggest strength in the first period was their pace , but as that died out in the second half , so did the team as a whole . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to bounce back when they host the Philadelphia 76ers ( 2 - 30 ) on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday . The Sixers ( 2 - 9 ) made a couple of changes up front to their starting lineup , and both proved key to their second straight home win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] took his starting turn in the ongoing center rotation with var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] and led the team with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , while var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who entered the first unit in place of var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , was right behind him with a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point tally . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also received 49 points from their bench , which was spearheaded by a trio of double - digit scoring efforts . In all , the home team posted a stellar 55 percent success rate from the field . while also holding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent tally . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was unsurprisingly led by var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who managed var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][PF] rebounds and a steal . Otto_Porter managed a 15 - point , 13 - rebound double - double , which also included an assist , four steals and a block . He struggled considerably from the field , however , going just 5 - of - 17 . var_player[1][2][FIRST_NAME] Gorat tallied a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with a var_player[1][6][PTS] - point effort . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] complemented his team - high scoring haul with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][1][FG3M] boards to his var_player[0][1][PTS] points . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , a rebound and a block . The bench was led by var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][FG3M] assists and a rebound . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] responded to his demotion to the second unit with an impressive var_player[0][6][FGA] - point , var_player[0][6][REB] - rebound double - double . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] also contributed var_player[0][9][PTS] points in a reserve role , along with var_player[0][9][FG3A] rebounds , an assist and a steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the New_York Knicks on Thursday , while the Sixers head to Minnesota for their Thursday date with the Minnesota Timberwolves .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the Pepsi Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Coming out of the third quarter , the game was tied at 65 - 65 and anyones to lose . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got hot in the fourth though , and out - scored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] to finish off the game and steal a road win in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also made a huge difference at the free throw line , making var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - of - 30 , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] made just 9 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were again without both var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] Sunday . Their backcourt picked up the slack this time around . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the charge , going var_player[1][4][AST] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field to score a team - high of var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while adding var_player[1][4][AST] rebounds and var_player[1][4][REB] assists . He had recorded three straight double - doubles coming into this matchup , but he was n't able to keep the streak alive . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 17 points and 10 assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong showing as well , finishing with var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][3][AST] assists in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . He 's now combined for 38 points and 10 assists over his last two games . Starting in place of var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG ) and var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds . Despite averaging only 6 points on the season , he 's played well in extended time lately , reaching double figures in points in three straight games . Both var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][6][PTS] points off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] saw their biggest production from var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . With so many injuries and shake - ups to the starting lineup , he 's been one of the few consistent players , posting 20 or more points in three of his last four games . Over those four games , he 's averaging 19 points and 4 rebounds . Getting the start at shooting guard with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] using a small lineup due to var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] 's injury , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was very successful in extended minutes . He went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from the three - point line to score 19 points , to go along with two steals in 29 minutes . It marked just the fourth time this season he reached double figures in points , so it was a nice surprise for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Coming off the bench , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] continued with his impressive stretch . In 20 minutes , he double - doubled with 16 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , 10 rebounds and two steals . Since joining the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] at the trade deadline , he 's averaging var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points and 5 rebounds over five games .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 15 - 24 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday night . In a battle of two struggling teams , the home team prevailed in a much needed way . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] came into this game in the midst of a nine - game losing streak and ended up pulling away with some good offense as a small underdog . They shot 49 percent from the field and went 19 - for - 33 from three - point range in a shooting exhibition . The benches were a huge disparity here , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench has three players score var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] or more points , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had only one bench player score more than five . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have now lost five - straight and they are now below .500 for the first time since the middle of November . It 's clear the injury to var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] is really hurting this team , as they ca n't get anything going on either end of the floor . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] has been playing at an all - time level recently though , but he ca n't do it all himself . He tallied 25 points , six assists and four rebounds in yet another great game . All five starters scored in double - figures actually , but they simply allowed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to run up and down the floor on them far too often . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to end this slide on Saturday against the surging Los_Angeles Clippers . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] needed a win as bad as any team in the NBA and they finally got one here . The amazing part is that they did it with defense , by holding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points in the final quarter . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the star of the show , as he totaled var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FGM] assists and var_player[0][4][TO] rebounds in the victory . The bench was fantastic as well , as T.J. var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] all scored between var_player[0][8][PTS] and var_player[0][7][PTS] points while combining for 21 rebounds , var_player[0][5][FGM] assists and four steals . Without Eric_Bledsoe for the rest of the season , they need more team performances like this going forward in order to dig out of this deep hole they 've dug themselves . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be on Friday when they host the Miami Heat in a difficult matchup .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , in the NBA Finals on Thursday to force Game 7 . In a game where var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had to win to extend their season , they did n't disappoint . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came out in a fury , as they outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] in the first quarter . In fact , they held var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] scoreless for the first five minutes , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] missed their first seven shots . The difference in the game was the shooting , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] were held to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent on their end . The rebounding was a benefactor for the Cavs as well , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] recording var_team[0][TEAM-REB] rebounds to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] recorded 12 steals and seven blocks as well in one of their best team defensive performances of the season . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] knew they had two games to secure their second - straight title and they simply did n't play with enough fire in this game . Steph var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] once again carried the load , as they combined for 55 points , with both players shooting under 45 percent from the field . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] fouled out with five minutes left and was ejected for the first time in his career after throwing his mouthpiece into the stands . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other productive starter , as he finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists in the loss . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[1][0][FT_PCT] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field and recorded just var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and no assists on the night . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][7][PTS] points off the bench , with the other seven bench player combining for just var_player[1][7][MIN] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] looked down and out after their Game 4 defeat at home , but have made some serious amends with their last two victories . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the star yet again , tallying var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][AST] assists , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][BLK] blocks and var_player[0][0][STL] steals in the win . var_player[0][10][FIRST_NAME] actually scored 18 - straight points for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] between the third and fourth quarters , which approached an NBA Finals record . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] of his own , while also providing var_player[0][4][STL] blocks and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double , as he accumulated var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in the victory .

The deciding game is Sunday in Oakland .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday . The form of these teams would indicate an easy var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] win , but once var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] was declared inactive , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] felt as it was their game to have . They took care of business too , as they pulled out a wire - to - wire win and won each individual quarter by at least three points . Defense was key for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting , while forcing var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers to just var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] made baskets . Three-point shooting really carried var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] as well , as they went 16 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] from long range in their win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) are coming off a historic win against the Golden_State Warriors on Sunday , but it led to var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] being rested here and a lackluster performance from the rest of the team . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in scoring , as he accrued var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FGM] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double , tallying var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][FGA] rebounds , while committing var_player[1][1][TO] turnovers in the defeat . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , Key var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] all provided var_player[1][6][PTS] points a piece off the bench . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will be back to full force on Thursday in their next game against the Boston Celtics . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have been in a terrible slide recently and a win over the team like the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] may be what they need to get going . var_player[0][5][FIRST_NAME] Harries was moved to the bench last week and he continues to thrive in that role , as he led the team with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][FTA] assists . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][4][STL] of his best games of the season , as he accumulated var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][4][TO] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] controlled the paint for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as he totaled var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field to collect var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][REB] steals . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game is on Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks .
The benches were thin Wednesday , but ended up playing a huge factor in the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] win against the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Four bench players for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] combined for 40 points , 17 rebounds and var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] assists , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's three bench players accumulated just 17 points , seven rebounds and four assists . Despite going var_player[1][2][FT_PCT] - for - var_player[1][2][FTA] from the free - throw line , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong game , posting var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][FTA] blocks . The var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] assists on 47 made baskets for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shows its new up - tempo offense , as eight of the nine players who played recorded a dime in the win . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] struggled in his debut with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , tallying var_player[0][1][PTS] points and seven rebounds on var_player[0][1][FGM] - for - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting . In addition , his - 18 plus - minus was the worst in the game . All five starters for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] played at least 35 minutes , and this could end up being var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] of the shortest rotations in the NBA .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] trailed by an var_player[1][4][FT_PCT] - 72 margin entering the fourth quarter but var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - foot three - point jumper with var_player[1][4][TO] seconds remaining in regulation knotted the score at 102 . OKC then dominated the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] by a 12 - 4 margin in the extra period and also won the battle on the glass , 57 - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's mammoth var_player[1][4][PTS] - point , var_player[1][4][REB] - rebound , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - assist triple - double led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[1][8][PTS] - point , var_player[1][8][REB] - rebound double - double off the bench . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][3][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards . Six players posted double - digit scoring for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , with var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points leading the way . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][1][PTS] . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] supplied an var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][4][FGA] - point , var_player[0][4][PTS] - rebound double - double led the bench . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[1][0][PTS] points .
var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was expected to win this game rather easily , but var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had some other ideas . What makes this win even more unlikely is the fact that the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played without Rudy_Gay ( hip ) and had var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] struggle mightily , eventually fouling out in the fourth quarter . The key for them was transition baskets , as they won the fastbreak differential , 20 - 9 . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] still finished the game with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , but went just var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field before fouling out . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the hero for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as he totaled var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds in his best game in years . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] got the start for Gay and tallied var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] made his return from a back injury to accumulate var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in a rusty performance . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in scoring , accruing var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other starter in double figures , as he accrued var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] boards .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] limited the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] percent shooting overall , including var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . Meanwhile , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] tallied a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the floor , overcoming their var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] turnovers . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] - point , var_player[1][3][REB] - rebound double - double paced var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was next with a bench - leading var_player[1][7][PTS] points . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][1][PTS] . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][BLK] blocks and var_player[0][4][STL] steal . Backcourt mate var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] followed closely behind with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while Otto_Porter , Jr. bounced back from a scoreless outing over 19 minutes Wednesday to generate a full stat line of 18 points , var_player[0][3][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[0][3][DREB] assists , var_player[0][3][DREB] steals and var_player[0][3][STL] block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[0][1][PTS] points , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] produced var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assist in an uncharacteristically modest performance .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) handled the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , on Thursday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] enters the All-Star break with a four - game winning streak in hand , during which they held each opponent below 100 points . On the backs of five players achieving double - digit points , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in each quarter , yet remain behind in the season series , 1 - 2 . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , marking just the fourth time this season he 's surpassed that threshold . In the frontcourt , both var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][DREB] rebounds ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][REB] points and var_player[0][2][REB] boards ) tallied double - doubles , with the Spaniard notching his 14th in row . Meanwhile , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] garnered his third starting nod in var_player[0][3][FG3A] contests due to the absences of Jimmy_Butler ( shoulder ) and Kirk_Hinrich ( toe ) , and the second - year pro responded with var_player[0][3][PTS] points and a game - high var_player[0][3][FG3M] three - pointers in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . Once var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] returns from their midseason respite , the Detroit Pistons await on Friday , Feb. var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] in the Palace of Auburn Hills . Thursday 's defeat doubles as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's second in var_player[1][0][AST] outings , but var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] did everything in his power to keep the deficit somewhat close , accruing var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . However , with var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] out of commission as a result of a corneal abrasion sustained during Wednesday 's win against the Miami Heat , the road was all the more winding when 16 turnovers were transformed into 24 points for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' foibles on offense were compounded by miserable success from three - point range - - just var_player[1][0][TO] - for - var_player[1][0][PTS] , or var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent - - and subsequently , just var_player[1][4][DREB] of var_player[1][8][FIRST_NAME] ' teammates scored in double figures , including var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][4][PTS] ) , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][PTS] ) , and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][1][PTS] ) . After the break , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will embark upon a three - game road trip , tipping off first against the Washington Wizards on Friday , Feb. var_team[1][TEAM-AST] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) won their fifth straight game while extending the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) losing streak to 10 consecutive games , effectively diminishing their playoff hopes in the var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] win . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was disqualified from the second half with a concussion , per league protocols . The two teams combined for 25 points in the third quarter . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] took advantage of var_player[1][2][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's absence , scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] points in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes and attempting a career - high var_player[0][1][FTA] free throws . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] grabbed var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and blocked var_player[0][2][FTA] shots in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , padding his stats in a last ditch effort to garner Defensive Player of the Year votes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] has now won 12 of their past var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] games , overlapping with the trade of Enes_Kanter to Oklahoma_City . They 're seven games back of the final playoff spot with 17 games remaining , drawing an outside shot of postseason basketball if everything falls their way . var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] was suspended after squaring off in a head - butting competition with the Trail Blazers ' Joel_Freeland in Friday 's loss . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was forced from the game with a sore hip , but he returned briefly in the waning moments to inbound the ball . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was benched down the stretch , turning the ball over var_player[1][4][TO] times and making var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shots . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench accounted for 52 points in the loss . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] host the Charlotte Hornets on Monday , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] get two days off before playing the Memphis Grizzlies at home .
Point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] returned from a toe injury in Thursday 's game between the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , and played as though he had n't missed any time at all . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points , shooting a ridiculous var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field with var_player[0][4][FG3M] three - pointers . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists and came away with var_player[0][4][STL] steals on the defensive end . Defensive anchor var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , had var_player[0][2][OREB] blocks and var_player[0][2][OREB] steals while leading the team with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . Wings var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][0][PTS] points each , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished the night with 15 three - pointers and over 47 percent shooting from the field . For the Sixers , meanwhile , the game was much less eventful . Forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . Rookie var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] , however , sat the game out for rest , and no other Sixer scored more than 14 .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shut down the powerhouse var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at FedExForum Arena on Monday . Defense was the key for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , who held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to just 36 percent shooting and a season - low scoring output . The absence of var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] superstar var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( quad ) certainly helped the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' case , but it was a stunning defensive performance nonetheless . The `` Grit and Grind `` Grizz blocked a whopping 11 shots on the night , including var_player[0][9][BLK] off the bench from big man var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] . Though the Grizz struggled on offense , hitting just four three - pointers and shooting under 40 percent , the team forced an even tougher night for its opponent . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] forced an unusual var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) remains the league 's second - best team , but certainly could have used var_player[1][12][SECOND_NAME] 's offense on Monday . In his absence , the team 's high scorer was bench veteran var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who contributed only var_player[1][7][PTS] points in var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes of play . It was a particularly off night for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in terms of ball movement , as the team recorded only var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists on the night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hit just four three - pointers and were unable to match the defensive intensity of their tough opponent . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit Philadelphia on Wednesday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will host the Suns .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Wells Fargo Center on Monday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was expected to win this game easily against a shorthanded Sixers team and they took care of business in relatively routine fashion . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] could n't get out of their own way , as they were destroyed by turnovers and fouls . In fact , the Sixers committed 25 fouls and allowed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to take 39 free - throw attempts , while converting on 33 of them . The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive as well , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] recording seven more assists than the Sixers , while committing var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] less turnovers . The third quarter is when var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] put distance between them and Philly , as they outscored the Sixers , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - 24 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were the first team to clinch a playoff berth last week and this win guaranteed another var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - win season . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he tallied var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][DREB] assists and var_player[1][3][STL] steals . Steph var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] went just var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field , but still accumulated var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][TO] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] steals . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][FTA] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][FGM] steals in an all - around gem . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was extremely efficient , as he totaled var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][FGM] rebounds on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGM] shooting in just 14 minutes of action . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will continue their road trip on Tuesday when they play the Washington Wizards for their next game . The Sixers ( 22 - 37 ) had a tough task here without var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] and they simply did n't have enough bullets in the arsenal to defeat this potent var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bunch . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was Philly 's best player , as he collected var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][REB] assists in the defeat . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FG3M] assists and var_player[0][0][STL] steals . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a game to forget , as he amassed just var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][FGA] rebounds in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , while committing a season - high var_player[0][2][TO] turnovers . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 35 points , var_player[0][5][FGA] rebounds and nine assists of the bench .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday . Both clubs entered the game without their starting centers , but it was a tad more of an unexpected development for the home team . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] found out earlier in the day that var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] had been suspended for Tuesday night 's game for making contact with an official while protesting a technical foul on Saturday versus the Wizards . With var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] also sidelined with a left hip strain , veteran var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , reacquired earlier in the month from the Clippers , got the starting call versus var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . His counterpart on the other side was a well - traveled veteran as well , as var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] took the court in Hassan_Whiteside 's stead yet again due to the latter 's oblique injury . Both var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] demonstrated why they 're still viable pieces of their respective squads , with the former coming second only to var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] in scoring for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on the night , and the latter posting a double - double to help keep var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] close the majority of the contest . Ultimately , it was var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's remarkable effort , as well as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent tallies from the field and three - point range , respectively , that spearheaded the high - scoring victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who has come on offensively over the stretch that Whiteside has missed . He managed 17 points , eight rebounds , three assists and a steal . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was right behind him with a var_player[1][3][PTS] - point , var_player[1][3][REB] - rebound , var_player[1][3][REB] - assist effort that also included a steal and a block . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a solid performance against the feisty defense of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , totaling var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FGM] assists . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][2][PTS] points of his own , which he supplemented with var_player[1][2][REB] boards and an assist . The starting five 's tally was rounded out by var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who supplied var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , an assist and a block . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with some scoring punch off the bench in leading the reserves , registering var_player[1][7][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][7][FTA] rebounds , var_player[1][7][FG3A] assists and a block . With the loss , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell a half - game back of the Atlanta Hawks for first place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain in the state of Texas for a Wednesday night showdown with the Dallas Mavericks . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] points led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , and he also dished out var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][PF] steals and a block . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] checked in with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , an assist , var_player[0][2][STL] steals and a block in his spot start . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] contributed on the offensive end as well , amassing var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[0][4][FTA] assists and a block . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] bench with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][FTM] assists and a steal , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] received some extended playing time due to the depleted frontcourt , and turned in var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , an assist and a steal in a reserve role . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head to Phoenix to face off with the Suns on Thursday .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] found a way to hang around until the last possession after streaky shooting and shot selection almost denied a comeback . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] started cold in the first half , but regained momentum in the second half and finished the night with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting . With under 0:10 left to play in the fourth quarter , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] intercepted an inbound pass that var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] could not get control of , which gave the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] a chance to tie or win the game . After a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] timeout , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] pulled up behind the arc , but could not get the shot to fall as time expired . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's heads up steal went along with var_player[1][3][FGA] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FTM] assists , but the shooting guard could not connect from the 3 - point line , going var_player[1][3][FG3_PCT] - for - var_player[1][3][FGM] in the effort . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] struggled in the second game of a back - to - back , finishing with var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebound on var_player[1][1][FG_PCT] percent shooting . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are now on a four game losing streak . The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received a passionate and strong performance from var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who led all scorers with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] threaded the needle in his signature fashion on multiple set pieces and added var_player[0][4][PTS] points alongside var_player[0][4][AST] assists , including a var_player[0][4][FTA] handed jam that got Sleep Train Arena on their feet . var_player[0][0][FIRST_NAME] Caspi drained the var_player[0][0][FG3A] free throws the ended up being the difference at the conclusion of the game and completed the night with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was effective off the bench adding var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][AST] assists in 24 minutes .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came out hot right from the beginning Sunday , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 52 - 36 in the first half alone . With such a huge lead at half , they were able to coast to any easy victory , securing the 12 - point victory in convincing fashion . While the teams shot similar percentages from the field , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had a huge advantage from beyond the arc , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot a meager var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] continued with his MVP-like numbers , finishing with var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists in 32 minutes . He has had an unbelievable four game stretch , averaging 37 points over that span . With var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] sitting out with an ankle injury , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] got the start at center , but really struggled to get anything going , finishing with only var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][STL] - var_player[1][2][OREB] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . Helping to ease the blow of var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] 's absence , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] had a productive game off the bench . He recorded 11 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) and five rebounds in 25 minutes . He 's averaging 12 points and 6 rebounds on the season . Both var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures in points as well with var_player[1][7][PTS] and var_player[1][6][PTS] points respectively . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] found most of their production from the bench . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was the biggest contributor , going var_player[0][5][FGM] - for - var_player[0][5][FGA] from the field to score var_player[0][5][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds in only var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . It marked his seventh double - double of the year , but first since January ninth . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] was the other productive bench player . He struggled with his shot all night ( 2 - 9 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt ) , but forced his way to free throw line 14 times , converting on 10 - of - 14 of those attempts to put his game total at 14 points . He also chipped in with six assists as well . Starting at shooting guard with var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] done for the season , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Oracle Arena on Saturday . There are n't many NBA games that are as lopsided as this one , but that 's just how good the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] can be . Not only did they lead by 21 at the half , they took a 44 - point lead into the fourth quarter . The shooting was incredible , as they went 57 - of - 92 from the field and 17 - of - 34 from three - point range . Rebounding was a huge difference as well , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] winning that battle , 47 - 32 . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also handed out var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists on their 57 made baskets . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had to play this game without Chris_Paul , but not even his elite defense could have done anything about this onslaught . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] did all he could for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he led the team with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][PF] rebounds and var_player[1][1][DREB] assists , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] played 37 minutes and accumulated var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] played well off the bench , totaling var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][AST] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be off until Wednesday , when they play the Phoenix Suns on the road for their next game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have the best offensive numbers in the league , but this performance may have been their best of the season . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was unconscious , as he tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in three quarters of action . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was second on the team , as he accrued var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other starter in double figures , as he dropped var_player[0][3][PTS] points . Those three players combined to go 31 - of - 45 from the field . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had a nice game off the bench , providing var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][AST] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will play the Portland Trail_Blazers on Sunday for their next game in the second half of a back - to - back set .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was playing on the second night of a back - to - back set , coming off a 100 - 96 loss to the Utah Jazz on Tuesday . As coach Gregg Popovich is wont to do , he opted to sit all of his starters , since the team was already missing several players due to injury . var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( hamstring ) missed his third straight game . Kawhi_Leonard suffered a hand injury in Tuesday 's game that kept him out as well . var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] sat out to get rest , though var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] is supposedly dealing with a shoulder issue as well . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] had missed all but var_player[0][9][PF] game so far this season with a calf injury but made his return to action Wednesday , playing var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes off the bench . All 10 available players saw action for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , and all of them finished with a positive plus/minus . They 'll host the Los_Angeles Lakers on Friday , and if the team is eager to get their players more rest , it 's possible they 'll use the same lineup Friday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is on a 10 - game losing streak , and the media 's honeymoon with the new front office led by Phil Jackson and the team 's rookie head coach Derek Fisher seemed to come to an end this week as several outlets began questioning his rotation choices and the team 's dogged push to install the triangle offense . As a team , they performed well on offense , shooting 49 percent from the field , but they committed 25 personal fouls , giving the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 25 free points at the foul line , which ultimately was their downfall . var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] sat out the game with left knee soreness . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will continue their road trip in Boston on Friday against the Celtics , and var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] 's status for the game remains unknown .
The normally porous var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] held the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to sub - var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent tallies from the field and three - point range and elicited var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . However , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] snapped a 99 - 99 deadlock at the buzzer , capping a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point effort that he supplemented with var_player[0][0][FTA] boards , var_player[0][0][AST] assists and var_player[0][0][AST] steals . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] went for var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] boards and an assist . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] turned in var_player[0][2][PTS] points , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] collected var_player[0][2][FGM] points but supplied var_player[0][2][PTS] assists , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and a pair of steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a remarkable night of his own , tallying var_player[1][2][PTS] points . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] checked in with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] went for var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] mustered a modest var_player[1][1][PTS] points but hauled in 14 boards . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][6][PTS] points led the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bench .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Thursday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] checked in to Thursday with an 0 - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] record , with half of those defeats having come on the road . Despite their struggles , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had opened the season on a tear , with var_player[1][1][BLK] games of over var_player[1][1][PTS] points . It was therefore fitting that the All-Star forward led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to their first win , pacing them with 32 points and adding var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] rebounds , two assists , four blocks and two steals . His last two points of the night were the most important , as he sank two free throws with 12 seconds remaining to seal the win . He was supported by double - digit scoring performances from three other members of the starting five , as well as a collective 30 points from the bench . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was second behind var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][PF] assists , var_player[1][3][FTM] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[1][4][PTS] - point , var_player[1][4][AST] - assist double - double , along with var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and a steal . Terrance var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] supplied var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and a block . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] registered a pair of var_player[1][6][PTS] - point efforts in reserve roles as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were led by a game - and - season - high var_player[0][1][PTS] points from var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , and added var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , an assist , a block and a steal . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[0][0][BLK] blocks , an assist and a steal . var_player[0][7][FIRST_NAME] Brodgon registered var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][7][AST] assists and a steal to lead the reserves . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] heads back home and will try for their second win against the Los_Angeles Lakers on Saturday night , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] remains home for their own Saturday night tussle with the Memphis Grizzlies .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_player[1][0][TO] ) got var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points from rookie var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , but it was n't enough to hold off the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Friday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] fell 98 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] for its second consecutive defeat after losing to the Bulls on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ( 5 - of - 20 ) from three , trailed by var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] entering the fourth quarter but were never able to completely erase the lead . A var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] steal and dunk trimmed the deficit to var_player[1][0][FG3A] with 1:28 to play , but var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] responded with a basket on the other end . Then , following a var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] layup , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] rebounded a var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] airball and laid it in , pushing the lead back to var_player[0][0][FTM] . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] would go on to close the game out at the free throw line . For the second straight game , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got production from a number of sources , as 10 players saw double - digit minutes . Leading scorer var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FTM] rebounds , joining var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] as the only var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in double - figures . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes , while var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who entered the starting lineup in place of var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] , added var_player[1][8][FGM] points and var_player[1][3][FGA] assists . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][7][PTS] points off the bench , as did var_player[1][8][SECOND_NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had six players in double - figures , led by var_player[0][3][PTS] points from var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] points , including var_player[0][4][FG3M] three - pointers , and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][FGA] rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] continued to struggle from the floor , shooting var_player[0][0][OREB] - of - var_player[0][0][PTS] ( var_player[0][0][TO] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) en route to var_player[0][0][FGA] points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , which out - rebounded Chicago by eight on Wednesday , grabbed var_team[1][TEAM-REB] rebounds , compared to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-REB] .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , to take a var_team[0][TEAM-AST] series lead in the Eastern Conference first - round playoffs Tuesday at Philips Arena . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were out of it early , as they scored just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in the first quarter , the fewest in an opening quarter in the playoffs since the NBA adopted the shot clock in 1954 . It was also a franchise low for any quarter in the playoffs . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] missed 20 of 23 shots in the first quarter , including six 3 - point attempts , and had six shots blocked . Despite an abysmal var_player[0][1][AST] - for - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting night from star forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] easily outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . This was due in large part to var_player[0][3][FG3M] big 3 - pointers from sharpshooting veteran var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[0][3][PTS] points . Also recording var_player[0][2][PTS] was All-Star big man var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who blocked var_player[0][2][REB] shots . Things have gotten off to a rocky start for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the series . Guard Avery_Bradley will likely miss the remainder of the series with a right hamstring injury , while guard var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and big man Kelly_Olynyk have more minor injuries . Overall , though , Bradley ( the team 's second - leading regular season scorer ) was missed on Tuesday , as the team finished 28 of 88 from the floor ( 32 percent ) . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] and forward var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] combined for a dismal var_player[1][3][PF] of 20 . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to turn things around at home in Game 3 on Friday .

O.J var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_player[0][6][PTS] points in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had a huge impact on the defensive end with var_player[0][6][FG3M] blocks and a steal . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] also pulled down var_player[0][5][PF] offensive rebounds and var_player[0][5][REB] boards overall . Three of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's bench players scored as many or more points than all of its starters individually . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to use the momentum from Saturday 's victory to stay alive in the series Monday .
With double - digit scoring performances from all five starters , the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took down the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Saturday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . Guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] neared a triple - double on Saturday , dropping var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , and var_player[0][3][AST] assists while also snagging var_player[0][3][PF] steals on the defensive end . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] went cold from deep , missing all var_player[0][3][FG3A] of his three - point attempts , but still managed to go an efficient var_player[0][3][FGM] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field . Red-hot sophomore var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also grabbed var_player[0][1][OREB] steals , while also scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] points and pulling down var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . The team as a whole shot an impressive 49 percent from the field while playing outstanding defense , holding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting on the night . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] could n't seal the deal despite var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds from star var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] . While var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][1][PTS] , the rest of the starting five scored just 30 total points , and the bench also saw struggles . Sixth man var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] scored just var_player[1][5][PTS] points in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes while turning the ball over var_player[1][5][TO] times . The team struggled mightily from deep , hitting just 21 percent of their three - pointers . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will face the Golden_State Warriors on Monday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Nets on Sunday .
There is no doubt var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] is having an All-Star season with the numbers he has been producing , as Monday 's var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][REB] - rebound performance was his eighth double - double of the season and brought his season averages to var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][0][FGM] assists per game . But perhaps the most overlooked stat of var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's breakout season is his steal totals , which , after recording var_player[0][0][OREB] in Monday 's loss to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , is now up to var_player[0][0][OREB] per game . The Greek Freak has now managed to record at least two steals in his last four games and in five of his last seven . He has also had five games this season where he has gotten at least four steals and is currently behind only Chris_Paul for the NBA lead in steals per game . So , while all eyes are on var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's ability to fill up the box score on the offensive end , he is turning out to be just as effective of a player on the other side of the ball as well .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Verizon Center on Tuesday . Just a few games ago , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were in the midst of a forgettable stretch where they lost five of six contests . However , after some tinkering with the starting five , they 've started to find the right balance and hit their stride . Never has that been more evident than Tuesday , when they exploded for a season - high point total . It was notably the second unit , which includes a pair of former starters in var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , that carried the night for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they combined for a whopping 73 points . That superb effort helped overcome a herculean performance from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who went for a season - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] actually led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] overall , posting a team - high var_player[1][6][PTS] points and supplementing that total with var_player[1][6][AST] assists , a rebound , var_player[1][6][STL] steals and var_player[1][6][FG3A] blocks over var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes on the court . It was a season - high point total for the point guard , who 'd posted three straight single - digit scoring outings prior to Tuesday . The second - and third - highest scorers for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were also on the second unit , with var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] compiling var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][DREB] rebounds and an assist in just var_player[1][8][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][FTA] - rebound double - double that also featured var_player[1][2][AST] assists and var_player[1][2][PF] blocks . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] registered a pair of var_player[1][1][PTS] - point efforts , with the former posting var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and an assist , and the latter supplying var_player[1][3][PF] rebounds , an assist and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] managed a var_player[1][5][REB] - point , var_player[1][5][PTS] - rebound double - double on the second unit as well . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][DREB] steals to his game - high scoring haul . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was a distant second on the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][FG3M] rebounds and var_player[0][3][FG3M] assists . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][1][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][OREB] assists and a block . Otto_Porter ( seven points ) and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] points ) turned in modest offensive totals , but the latter did also haul in var_player[0][2][FGA] rebounds , along with an assist , a steal and a block . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with a full stat line of var_player[0][6][PTS] points , five rebounds , var_player[0][6][AST] assists and a steal .

It was vastly different story Saturday , however , as the veteran guard exploded for 31 points and a career - high 11 rebounds . The scoring total largely consisted of a personal - best eight three - pointers , and he and backcourt mate var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] combined for over half of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's points on the night . They also helped the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) tally a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field , including a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent figure from beyond the arc , with the latter number nearly doubling the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) number . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PF] assists and a steal to his stellar stat line . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[1][4][PTS] points and added var_player[1][4][FTA] assists and a rebound . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][AST] boards , var_player[1][2][AST] assists , var_player[1][2][PF] blocks and a steal , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's full stat line included var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][REB] assists , var_player[1][0][STL] blocks and var_player[1][2][FTA] steals . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] once again served as the linchpin of the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] attack , which has been decidedly top - heavy so far this season . He posted 29 points , three assists , two rebounds and three steals . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had his hands full all night on defense with var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] and totaled a modest var_player[0][3][PTS] points of his own , along with var_player[0][3][FTA] assists , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and a pair of blocks . No other starter managed double - digit scoring , although var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , starting at center , did haul in var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] III paced the bench with var_player[0][7][PTS] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to take on the Bulls on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] face off with the Sixers in a home tilt Wednesday as well .

Big men var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] III and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] made up for Cody_Zeller 's absence with var_player[0][6][PTS] and var_player[0][7][PTS] points , respectively , off the bench . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] also stepped up with a pair of var_player[0][8][PTS] efforts in reserve roles . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent tallies from the field and three - point range outpaced OKC 's corresponding 44 and 30 percent figures .

Seven var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] scored in double figures , led by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] moved to within var_player[0][4][OREB] game of matching its franchise - long winning streak set in 2001 - 2 . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][2][PTS] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][3][PTS] points . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] matched the latter with var_player[0][5][PTS] off the bench as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's resevers came up big . Corey var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][8][PTS] points while var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] both scored var_player[0][7][PTS] . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] was var_player[0][5][FG3M] of var_player[0][5][FG3A] from three - point range to pace the reserves , who outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench , 51 - 29 . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , who also took two games this season from the Lakers , swept the season season series from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , marking the first time in franchise history they have swept both var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] teams in a season . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists to lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who jumped to a var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - point first - quarter advantage before faltering . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds while var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][3][PTS] points . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench , though , could n't match var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's as the resevers were held to 39 percent shooting from the field , including 2 of 10 from three - point range .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

Leading the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to the victory was the duo of var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTM] FT ) , and grabbed var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , giving him his seventh straight double - double and eleventh on the year . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] was in the starting lineup for the first time this season with Rudy_Gay sitting out with an Achilles injury . He shot 9 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes . He 's only averaging 7 points in 18 minutes per game this season , so the boost in playing time allowed him to surprise many with the dominant performance . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was also a replacement in the starting lineup , as var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] was out with a quad injury . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] also took advantage of the start and recorded var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][FTM] assists . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FTM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][BLK] - var_player[1][6][REB] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FTM] FT ) in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was n't his normal self tonight . He struggled to post the monster line he 's become accustomed to this season , as he shot only 4 - for - 12 from the field to finish with 14 points and nine rebounds . His output was well below his season averages of 26 points and 11 rebounds . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] played well on the other hand . He scored 22 points ( 10 - 17 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and added seven rebounds and five assists . The var_player[0][3][PTS] points matched a season - high for var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was really the only other big contributor in the loss . He shot 7 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 7 from beyond the arc to score 20 points . It was n't enough of a boost to beat a tough var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] team though . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Friday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Sunday .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are locked into second place in the Eastern Conference playoff standings , sitting 10 games behind the East-leading Atlanta Hawks , a chasm the Cavs are unlikely to be able to close with just 14 games left on the schedule for them this season . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hit the road against the Heat on Monday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will play the Rockets in Houston on Tuesday .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were dominant Monday night from start to finish , and while late in the fourth quarter it appeared as if the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were looking to make one last push , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had little trouble closing it out . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , scoring var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) , to go along with var_player[1][3][FTA] assists and var_player[1][3][BLK] blocks in 31 minutes . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] provided solid scoring off the bench , putting up var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FGM] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][FG3M] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] 3Pt ) in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . Despite their performances , the two still shot rather poorly , going a combined 11 - of - 31 from the field . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] got the start once again with Lowry continuing to sit out with a back injury , and he matched var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] ' var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FGM] 3Pt ) , while also recording var_player[1][6][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][5][FGM] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] missed his second consecutive game . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] got the start and logged a double - double with var_player[1][1][REB] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . With the win , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] tied the Chicago Bulls for third place in the Eastern Conference , although the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] own the tie breaker so they currently sit above them . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggled to get anything going Monday night . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only starter who scored in double figures with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][STL] - var_player[0][4][FTA] 3Pt ) , to go along with var_player[0][4][FTA] rebounds and just var_player[0][4][DREB] assists . The only other var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] players to score in double figures were the team 's var_player[0][7][FG3A] point guards off the bench , with var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] each scoring var_player[0][7][PTS] points on a combined var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - of - var_player[0][5][MIN] shooting . As a team , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot a dreadful var_team[0][TEAM-REB] percent percent from the field , and the loss really hurts their playoff chances , as they are now three games behind the Celtics for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Orlando on Friday and play the Magic , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will head to Atlanta Friday to take on the East-leading Hawks .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in overtime on Sunday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] took the win to tie the season series with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 1 - 1 . The win also helped end the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' seven - game losing streak that stretched back to Feb. 1 . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] was the catalyst Sunday , finishing with a team - high var_player[0][10][PTS] points in var_player[0][10][MIN] minutes off the bench . Four bench players finished with double - digit points , as coach Byron Scott turned to his reserves to lead the way . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have dropped var_player[1][5][STL] straight , but they did enjoy a nice debut performance from var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] . He finished with 21 points in 25 minutes off the bench before getting ejected for arguing an offensive foul call made against him with five minutes left in the fourth quarter . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] lead the rally back in the fourth to push the game to overtime , but it was var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] who hit a var_player[1][3][AST] - pointer as time expired to send the game into the extra period . var_player[0][10][SECOND_NAME] was a part of every scoring play in overtime , dishing out var_player[0][10][FG3A] assists in the additional five minutes and scoring var_player[0][10][PF] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Wednesday , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will wrap up their road trip in Phoenix on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals at Oracle Arena on Thursday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] lead the series , var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had their backs against the wall after losing Games var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] and 4 in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , but it 's a different game when your back is against the wall in your house . Oracle Arena was one of the toughest arenas to win in all season long for the opposition , and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] got back on track , ran their offense , found their stroke from behind the arc and held off a hungry var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] team . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did not make it an easy var_player[1][4][FTA] point win for the defending champions , as both players combined for 71 points and simply would not quit down double figures late in the fourth quarter . The first half went in favor of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as the small ball lineup returned to form behind var_player[0][1][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's physical play and an improved rebounding effort from the Michigan var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] product and his Australian counterpart , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went into the half down eight points , but var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] went to another level by attacking the rim possession after possession and willed his way to the free throw line . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished a perfect var_player[1][0][FTM] - of - var_player[1][0][FTA] from the charity stripe . Three of those free throws came late in the fourth quarter , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were on the brink of trimming a 10 point var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lead to five points . The all - star forward was fouled behind the arc by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , and drained all his free throws . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] then turned the ball over , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] drove the lane and got himself an and - var_player[1][0][BLK] , missed the free throw off the front of the rim , recovered the rebound and saw var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] at the three - point line . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] happened to miss the needed trey , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to close out the rest of the game . The sequence of events proved the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are at their hungriest and were not going down in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] without an intense fight . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][4][STL] steals and var_player[1][4][REB] turnovers , while var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] topped off the scoring column with var_player[1][0][PTS] points . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] has resurged himself in this series , and added var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] boards . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , as the backcourt combined for 58 points , 12 rebounds , var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][4][AST] steals ( var_player[0][4][STL] of which were var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's ) , on 17 - of - 41 shooting . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] stuffed the stat sheet to the tune of var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][BLK] assists and var_player[0][1][PF] blocks on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting , and added his best defense of the series when the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] needed it most . Game 6 will return to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] on Saturday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday evening . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] led by four after var_player[0][4][STL] quarters , but then var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] went absolutely ballistic in the fourth quarter , scoring 19 points in the quarter , including 15 points straight and unanswered , to take his team from down var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - 99 to the final score of 114 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . This snaps the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_player[0][4][STL] - game win streak , while var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added to his ridiculous triple - double count , as he notched his 25th of the season . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) only scored var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in the first quarter , before outscoring the Grizz by 12 in the second , to take an eight - point lead into half time . They were then outscored by 12 in the third , and entered the fourth down by four . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] outscored the Grizz by 14 in the fourth , behind var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and his takeover . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][MIN] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals to lead his squad to a big win . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] also matched a career - best as he went var_player[0][4][FTM] - of - var_player[0][4][FTM] from the foul line . Three other players scored in double digits for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , including var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , who pitched in var_player[0][6][PTS] points each . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] go on to visit Portland on Sunday . Meanwhile , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) saw their win streak come to an end as they went scoreless in the last 2:50 as they were stifled by an overwhelming push of energy and intensity from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and their home crowd . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with a team - high var_player[1][2][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[1][2][AST] assists , var_player[1][2][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][STL] steals and var_player[1][2][BLK] block , in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] came up big in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes off the bench , with var_player[1][4][FGA] points and var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][OREB] steals and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][DREB] - of - var_player[1][0][FTA] shooting , in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will have to put this one in the past , as they go right back in action on Saturday , when they visit Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , Monday night at Staples Center . In a game of runs , the game came down to who could make their free throws in the closing moments , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) converting on just enough of their free throw attempts to hold off the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , who refused to go away , in the end . Fresh off his 20 - point , 20 - assist performance Saturday against the Pelicans , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] put together yet another impressive double - double , posting var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][FGA] assists in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the way scoring for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] after missing the last game with knee soreness , posting var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points , var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . As a team , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were lethal from downtown , shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long range . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , however , were equally hot from behind the arc , shooting var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent themselves from three - point land . Regardless , they still fell a point short despite putting up an equally impressive performance overall . Their starting backcourt consisting of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] combined to score 49 points , while starting center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] put together his best performance of the 2016 - var_player[1][3][FGA] season , posting var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][PF] assists and var_player[1][3][FTM] blocks . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's performance put him in the same company as both Kevin_Durant and Giannis_Antetokounmpo as the only var_player[1][2][DREB] players to post such a stat line . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will head to Orlando Wednesday to take on the Magic , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head home Tuesday and play the Thunder .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday . While these are teams that have n't quite lived up to expectations this season , they left it all on the floor here . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] turned on the defense in the fourth quarter , as they held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points en route to a comeback win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] struggled all night from the field though , as they hit just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their shots . Rebounding was huge for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they won that battle , var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 38 . In addition , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] recorded var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists , while holding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to just var_team[1][TEAM-AST] . There were nine ties and 14 lead changes , as neither team led by more than seven points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has been a bit of a disappointment this season and losses like this only add to the skepticism . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] struggled from the field , as he accumulated var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][PTS] shooting . C.J . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] was second on the team , as he dropped var_player[1][6][PTS] points off the bench . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a nice all - around game , amassing var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][TO] assists and var_player[1][2][FGM] blocks in the defeat . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to play better on Friday in a road matchup against the New_Orleans Pelicans . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has not had the results they want this year , but they continue to play well and wins like this only confirm that point . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the player of the game , as he totaled var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other starter in double figures , as he tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . The bench was huge , as var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] all scored in double figures . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][6][REB] assists and var_player[0][7][BLK] blocks , while var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] accrued var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][AST] assists . On deck for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] is a home matchup against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . After losing the teams ' first matchup on Nov. var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] found a way to close the season series between these teams with a win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] lead the way with a game - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points to go with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][DREB] assists in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . His frontcourt compatriot , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , finished with a double - double of his own , posting var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] won a rough game by holding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent shooting from beyond the arc . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] moved into the starting lineup , replacing var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , but var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] struggled , posting just var_player[0][0][FGA] points and var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] scored 24 points off of 13 turnovers , but it was n't enough to overcome their deficiencies on offense . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] dislocated the ring finger on his right hand , but after a brief time in the locker room , he returned , finishing with a team - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points to go with var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][OREB] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . All-Star shooting guard , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was not himself , putting up just var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting from the field in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . After starting the season on a 24 - 7 run , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have regressed , putting together a woeful 3 - 8 record since Dec. 30 . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will fire up the barbecue for a matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers at home on Saturday , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will rub down the meat when they play the 76ers on Friday in Philadelphia .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has strung together three straight wins with their new starting lineup . Ironically enough , most of their success can be pointed to the improved play of their bench since var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] were moved into reserve roles . Taking var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] out of the starting lineup allows var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] to operate unecumbered as the loan dominant offensive player in the starting lineup while giving var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] possessions off the bench that do n't require var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] to force his touches . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Sunday with a bygone double - double of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to continue their recent success when they take on the woeful Indiana Pacers on Monday . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points vaulted him over Michael var_player[1][2][FIRST_NAME] in career points to land at third all - time for the NBA scoring record . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has lost two straight games , but wins and losses are no longer the focus of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' season as president Flip Saunders told the media this week that the team 's focus is now on rebuilding for the future , a path Saunders did not plan to walk down this season . However , with Ricky_Rubio ( ankle ) , Kevin_Martin ( wrist ) and var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] ( wrist ) all expected to miss as much as another month of action , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's hopes of competing for a playoff spot this season were dashed . They 'll embark on a two - game road trip Tuesday in Washington against the Wizards .
var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points , but it was n't enough to overcome a fourth quarter run by var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . Playing without var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] , as well as a number of other key reserves , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot 42 percent from the floor and 9 - of - 35 from beyond the arc . The offense relied heavily on var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] , who converted var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] field goals and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - of - var_player[1][3][FG3A] three - pointers to go with var_player[1][3][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][AST] steals . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - 14 FG , var_player[1][1][OREB] - var_player[1][4][PTS] 3Pt ) each had var_player[1][1][PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , winners of 14 straight , maintained its grasp on the league 's best record behind var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][3][PTS] points despite converting just var_player[0][0][OREB] - of - var_player[0][3][FGM] three - point attempts , and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][FGM] rebounds of his own . Starting in place of the injured Andrew_Bogut , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . The road ahead does n't get any easier for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , which takes on the Mavericks on Saturday . Following that matchup , New_Orleans , Memphis , Oklahoma_City and Sacramento await on the schedule . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , plays in Sacramento Thursday night . var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] is not expected to play and hopes to return for Saturday 's game against Denver .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at United Center on Thursday . In the final game before the All-Star break , these two teams left it all on the floor . In fact , there were eight ties and 14 lead changes , with neither team leading by more than 10 points . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the hero , as he hit var_player[0][0][FG3M] clutch free - throws with less than a second left to seal the win . Free-throw shooting was a key for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] all night , as they went a perfect var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] from the free - throw line .

As a team , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and were active defensively , recording var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] blocks and 10 steals . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will stay home to take on the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Thursday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head home Friday to take on Miami .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Barclays Center on Friday . The two teams came into Friday 's contest as polar opposites , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) looking to tally their 13th consecutive victory and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] ) trying to avoid a 12th straight defeat . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's one ray of hope was the fact that they 'd notched seven of their var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] wins on the season at home , and perhaps the more intangible factor of the odds eventually favoring a var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] loss and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] victory , given their respective extended streaks . However , as usual , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] could n't hang on to the ball with any degree of consistency , significantly undermining their chances . The home team committed 22 turnovers overall , while also getting outscored 59 - 46 in the second half . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench compiled 56 points overall , with var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] scoring a team - high var_player[1][7][PTS] , and adding var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][7][FG3A] assists , var_player[1][7][BLK] blocks and a steal . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steal . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][FTM] rebounds , var_player[1][6][PF] assists and var_player[1][6][OREB] steals . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steals . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][REB] boards and var_player[1][8][DREB] assist in var_player[1][8][MIN] minutes as a reserve . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] drew the start for var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( ankle ) and went for var_player[1][2][REB] points , var_player[1][2][PF] rebounds , var_player[1][2][FTA] assists and var_player[1][2][STL] steal , and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a quiet game despite the appealing matchup , posting var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][PTS] boards , var_player[1][2][STL] steal and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][2][PTS] points led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , a total he supplemented with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][FG3M] assist and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][FG3M] rebound and var_player[0][3][FG3A] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the third and final member of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with double - digit scoring , collecting var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] submitted a bench - leading var_player[0][10][PTS] points along with var_player[0][10][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][10][FG3A] assist . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] was productive as a reserve as well , managing var_player[0][8][DREB] points , hauling in var_player[0][8][REB] boards and dishing out var_player[0][8][PF] assist . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] next head to Philadelphia to tangle with the Sixers on Saturday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to face off with the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Thursday at Quicken Loans Arena . The score indicates a closer game than it actually was , as after the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 50 ) took a 17 - point lead headed into the final period , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came roaring back to at least make the game interesting , but six points was as close as they were going to get . After being rather passive scoring - wise through the first var_player[0][0][FG3A] games of the regular season , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] exploded going for a game - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points on top of var_player[0][0][FGM] assists and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . The other var_player[0][4][FTM] members of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's big var_player[0][4][FG3M] also put together big nights , with var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] recording var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][FG3A] rebounds , as he continues his hot start to the season , and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] scoring var_player[0][4][PTS] points of his own . As a team , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] managed to do plenty of damage from behind the arc — where they shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from — and the free throw line — where they shot an incredible 37 shots from , making var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] of them . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , on the other hand , came into this game missing both Jae_Crowder ( ankle ) and Al_Horford ( concussion ) and were carried by their starting backcourt consisting of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] recorded a game - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points while scoring nearly half of his points from the free throw line , as he shot var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][4][FTA] from the charity stripe . The rest of his var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] teammates struggled getting to the line , however , as they shot just 5 - of - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] from the stripe over the course of Thursday 's game . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was n't too far behind , recording a double - double of var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds over var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . It was rookie var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , however , who had the game 's breakout performance , scoring a career - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points and grabbing var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds after getting the start in place of the injured Crowder . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will head to Philadelphia on Saturday to take on the 76ers , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will have off until Sunday when they will take on the Nuggets .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) won their second straight close game , defeating the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . Down 59 - 52 at the half , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] flipped the switch in the fourth quarter , outscoring the Sixers 30 - 19 in the final period to secure their second consecutive victory . In a game featuring two of the more permeable frontcourts in the league , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] outrebounded var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-REB] to var_team[0][TEAM-REB] and outscored them in the paint , 44 to var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] . The Sixers were further weakened up front by the absence of standout rookie var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] , who was serving the second game of a team - imposed two - game suspension for recent off - the - court issues . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , as he has often done this season , spearheaded the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' offensive attack with a var_player[1][0][PTS] - point , var_player[1][0][FGM] - rebound performance , his second consecutive game over the 20 - point mark . The visitors also got a strong outing off the bench from var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , who is certainly in contention for the Sixth Man of the Year award at this point . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[1][6][PTS] points , and added var_player[1][6][DREB] rebounds , an assist and a steal over var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes to come in second behind var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] in team scoring . For the starters , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] turned in another solid start in place of Gary_Harris , notching var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , an assist and a steal . Rookie var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] only shot var_player[1][4][FG3_PCT] percent but managed to pitch in var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and a steal . He did commit seven turnovers , underscoring an area of his game he must continue to focus on . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench for var_player[1][9][MIN] minutes and was a rebound shy of a double - double , pouring in var_player[1][9][PTS] points and hauling in var_player[1][9][FTA] boards . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was the third var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] player to manage double - digit points in a reserve role , posting var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][AST] assists and a pair of rebounds . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] improved to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] but remains in last place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head home for a date with the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . The Sixers turned in a valiant effort without var_player[0][10][SECOND_NAME] , but could n't hold on to the lead in the second half . All var_player[0][0][FG3M] starters notably turned in double - digit scoring performances , led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][REB] - rebound double - double . The starting backcourt duo of var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and T.J.McConnell were also solid contributors , tallying var_player[0][3][PTS] and 10 points , respectively . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] in particular stuffed the stat sheet by adding var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][BLK] blocks ) and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][BLK] assists , a rebound , var_player[0][2][DREB] steals and a pair of blocks ) pitched in all over the court as well . Jakarr var_player[0][9][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[0][9][PTS] points ) and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][8][PTS] points ) also got in on the act from the bench , making it var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] of the best team efforts for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] in what has been a miserable campaign to date . The Sixers fell to 1 - 20 and remain last in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They are home for a tough matchup versus the San_Antonio Spurs on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) picked up a road win over the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) despite resting many of their top players Wednesday night at FedExForum , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . Tim_Duncan and Manu_Ginobili were both inactive , and var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] all sat out as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue to get their bodies rested for the postseason . Still , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] missing Marc_Gasol , Mike_Conley , var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] and P.J . var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] to injuries , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] faced little resistance as they took an 8 - point lead into halftime and led by double - digits for the entire fourth quarter . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's lone star in the lineup , and he dominated the game , scoring a game - high var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][DREB] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) and grabbing a game - high var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds ( var_player[1][1][OREB] offensive ) . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FG3M] - var_player[1][5][AST] 3PT ) added var_player[1][5][PTS] points in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot a robust var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's depleted front line offered little resistance inside . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's leading scorer as he managed var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points ( var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][FG3M] - var_player[0][7][REB] 3PT , var_player[0][7][FTM] - var_player[0][7][FTA] FT ) in var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes off the bench . Jeff_Green 's 12 points ( 5 - 9 FG ) led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's starters as the toll of playing through the Grizzlie 's myriad injuries is showing . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] managed just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and committed var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers against just var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists as the reserves continue to have trouble producing offense . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has now shot better than 50 percent from the field just once in its past 16 games . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain at home for a Wednesday matchup against Denver . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] return home to host the Pelicans on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Despite taking a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 50 lead into halftime , the Sixers came out of the half cold and were out - scored by the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - 28 in the third quarter , allowing them to coast to the 10 - point victory . The Sixers big men also struggled with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bigs , as they were out - rebounded by a hefty var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 29 margin . This is the eigth straight victory for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who now have the second best record in the Western Conference . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was an unstoppable force on Monday , as the Sixers ' young frontcourt had no answer for him . He went off for 33 points ( 13 - 20 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) and 11 rebounds , giving him his second straight double - double and fifth on the year . Fellow superstar var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] shot var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][4][DREB] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while also grabbing var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and handing out var_player[1][4][DREB] assists . He 's now averaging 20 points and 7 assists on the year . Wes var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was the other major contributor on the offensive side of the ball , as he shot var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][3][FG3A] from beyond the arc to score var_player[1][3][PTS] points in 32 minutes .

The Sixers were led by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored a season - high var_player[0][4][FGA] points , while also grabbing var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds .

Fellow backcourt mate var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] also had a solid all - around game on Monday . He came one assist shy of his second double - double of the season and finished with 20 points and nine assists . The third Sixer who reached the 20 - point mark was starting center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , which was a nice surprise for the Sixers as he 's only averaging 9 points on the season .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came away with a blowout win to snap a var_player[0][0][FTA] - game losing streak , but it took its toll on the home team , as they lost var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] ( hip flexor ) and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( quad ) during the game . Before the var_player[0][1][FG3M] injuries , the physical battle between var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] caused var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_player[0][1][REB] ) head coach Luke Walton to get ejected after arguing a controversial no call on var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] . Both players went to the ground , and it appeared that var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] had some part in pulling var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] down with him near the top of the key , off the ball . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] got some life following the ejection and used it to finish the half with a nine - point lead . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] bounced back on his own to lead the third quarter var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] surge , where the big man had a major part in outscoring the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] during that period . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had no response following the big scoring run for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

They knew they 'd have a challenge on their hands , however , as the Sixers ( 26 - 43 ) had been playing much better basketball than their record indicated and they 'd also be missing team MVP Isaiah_Thomas for a second straight contest with knee soreness . Accordingly , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] managed to play spoiler effectively , overcoming a 13 - point fourth - quarter deficit . Thomas ' absence certainly helped the Sixers ' cause , but they earned the upset victory by limiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to 40 percent shooting from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range , while also forcing var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points , a total he supplemented with var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][AST] assists , var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][2][FG3M] steal . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] filled out the stat sheet with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][FTM] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][STL] steal . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was next with a bench - leading var_player[1][7][PTS] - point , var_player[1][7][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][7][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][7][BLK] steal . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][DREB] assists and var_player[1][3][DREB] steals . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] was productive off the bench as well with var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][DREB] rebound and var_player[1][8][REB] assist . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] drew a second straight start in Thomas ' stead and chipped in var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][OREB] steals . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the Sixers with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][1][FG3M] steals . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][0][PTS] points , eight rebounds and var_player[0][0][FG3M] steals and drained the go - ahead three - pointer in the fourth period . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][FTA] boards and var_player[0][3][OREB] assist . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] exited early with knee soreness after var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , posting var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][OREB] rebound before heading to the bench . A trio of var_player[0][8][PTS] - point efforts from var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] return home to tangle with the Washington Wizards on Monday evening , while the Sixers head to Central Florida for a Monday night date with the Orlando Magic .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Spectrum Arena on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - var_player[0][4][FGM] ) have often counted on their standout guard combo of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] this season to serve as the foundation of their offense , and their contributions came in particularly handy Wednesday against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] that also featured an assist and a pair of blocks , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' dynamic duo countered with a var_player[0][4][PTS] - point tally from var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and a var_player[0][3][PTS] - point , var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - rebound effort from var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] . Despite the trio of remarkable performances , it was largely a defensive - minded contest , with both teams shooting under 40 percent from the field , and with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] posting a particularly unsightly var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] percent success rate from behind the arc . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was a distant second on var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][TO] assists and a block . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued to ramp up his minutes in his third game back from offseason knee problems , totaling var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][FG3M] assists and a block over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had quiet nights on the scoreboard by their standards with a pair of var_player[1][1][PTS] - point contributions , but the latter did haul in var_player[1][1][FGA] rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] headlined a modest outing for the second unit with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][AST] assists and var_player[1][5][DREB] rebounds . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][FG3M] steals to his game - high scoring haul , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] also dished out var_player[0][3][AST] dimes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was back in the starting lineup after missing six games with a knee injury and supplied var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FG3A] rebounds and a steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and a block , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the reserves with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds , an assist and var_player[0][5][PF] steals in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes .

The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) by a score of var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , on Saturday night . The game was a back - and - forth nail - biter , which featured 15 lead changes and was tied 108 - 108 with 2:54 left in the game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] grinded out the last few minutes with some solid defense , including a big steal which led to a basket that put them up by four with 50 seconds left . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] then gave up an unforced turnover on a five - second inbound violation that destroyed their chance of victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this game after a solid win on Christmas day and while they are still missing two big pieces in Joakim_Noah and Mike_Dunleavy , being short - handed on this second night of a back - to - back could be part of the reason why they collapsed late in the fourth . Five players scored in double digits for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The high - point man was var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG ) , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , in 36 minutes . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[1][1][PTS] points on strong var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting from the field ( var_player[1][1][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][FG3A] 3PT , var_player[1][1][FG3A] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , along with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks , var_player[1][1][STL] steals and var_player[1][1][OREB] assist , in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTA] - var_player[1][2][FTM] FT ) , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][BLK] assists and var_player[1][2][AST] blocks , in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starters were forced to play a lot of minutes in this one , which again could have affected their play late in the game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] did however shoot a strong 53 percent from the field . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also had six players score in double digits . J.J.Barea had a fantastic game filling in at starting PG for the injured var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while shooting a brilliant var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from behind the arc , along with var_player[0][3][AST] assists , in 32 minutes . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] dropped in var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][STL] - var_player[0][5][FG3A] 3Pt ) , var_player[0][5][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][5][REB] assists and var_player[0][5][STL] steals , in 35 minutes off the bench . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] tallied a solid double - double with var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot 48 percent from long range and hit 22 - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] free throws . With this win var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is now 6 - 6 against the East . Next var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will host Milwaukee on Monday and look to go above .500 against the pesky East . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will have their hands full once again , as they host Toronto on Monday for what should be a great Eastern Conference battle .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the AT & T Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] continued their unbelievable stretch , winning their eleventh game in a row and propelling themselves into the second spot in the Western Conference standings . After many had criticized the defending champs for their slow start to the season , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have made them eat their words , as they now own a half game lead over the Clippers , Grizzlies and Rockets for that second projected playoff seed . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . It was the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt duo of var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] that helped seal the victory Sunday . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][STL] blocked shots , while playing just var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . It was a very efficient showing for the veteran , who 's posted two double - doubles in a row . During that var_player[0][1][BLK] - game stretch , he 's combined for 51 points and 20 rebounds , so var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] is doing a great job of building even more momentum for himself as they head into the playoffs . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , went var_player[0][0][FGM] - for - var_player[0][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][0][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][0][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[0][0][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . He 's had a fantastic span of games throughout April , averaging 20 points over seven games . He 's also done it defensively though , posting three or more steals in four out of those seven games as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received some solid contributions off their bench . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][9][PTS] points ( var_player[0][9][FGM] - var_player[0][9][FGA] FG , var_player[0][9][TO] - var_player[0][9][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][9][FTA] - var_player[0][9][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][8][DREB] rebounds over var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][8][PTS] points ( var_player[0][9][REB] - var_player[0][8][FGA] FG , var_player[0][8][TO] - var_player[0][8][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][8][FTM] - var_player[0][8][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][8][DREB] assists over var_player[0][8][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] were the only var_player[1][7][FG3M] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' players that really had any success against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' defense . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] notched a double - double with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][4][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTA] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . He 's now combined for 39 points and 17 assists over his last three games . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , went var_player[1][7][FGM] - for - var_player[1][7][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][DREB] - for - var_player[0][3][FTA] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][7][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][7][DREB] rebounds over var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . Over his last five games , he 's now averaging 19 points , as he 's been one of the few bright spots for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] were the only other var_player[1][3][PF] players to reach double figures . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][BLK] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][TO] - var_player[1][1][FGM] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][REB] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FT_PCT] - var_player[1][3][OREB] 3Pt , var_player[1][2][BLK] - var_player[1][3][PF] FT ) and var_player[1][2][DREB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the New_Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Tuesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) held off the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] ) for a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] win on Sunday . This was a much closer matchup than anticipated , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hanging around all game long . The game was actually tied with six minutes left , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went on a 70 run from there to ultimately decide the game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's three - point shooting was the key , as they went 10 - for - 16 from long distance in the victory . They also shot 52 percent from the field , while holding var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to var_team[0][TEAM-REB] percent on their end . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has n't been playing impressively lately , but they continue to win games . This is the second game in a row where they allowed a double - digit underdog to hang around and score over 110 points . With that in mind , both of those games came without All-Star var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] . In this game , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points with var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] scoring var_player[1][5][PTS] of his own off the bench . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] also played well , as he tallied var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds en route to a double - double . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] next game will be against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] came into this matchup as a var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - point underdog and nearly pulled out a miraculous win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] got the start for the injured var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] and played great , double - doubling in a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound performance . The bench was what kept the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] around though , as var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] all scored at least var_player[0][9][PTS] points while combing for var_player[0][9][MIN] total rebounds . On deck for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] is a matchup with the Los_Angeles Clippers on Monday in the second half of a back - to - back set .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday night . A 14 - 2 run in the fourth quarter was the decisive moment for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in their victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] held var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to just 39 points in the second half and allowed them to shoot only seven free - throws in the game . The benches were a huge difference as well , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench scoring 46 points to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-AST] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's goal was to start the month with four wins before the All-Star break and they did just that with this victory . The var_player[1][5][AST] leading scorers for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came off the bench , as var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][5][PTS] in a double - double . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] gave the team some nice all - around performances , as they combined for 29 points , 10 rebounds , 10 assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] steals in the win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will be off until the 19th when they play the Sacramento Kings after the All-Star break . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had to play this game without var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] and it clearly hurt them late . var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] is one of the leading scorers in the final five minutes of games and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were completely shut down for a long stretch in the fourth quarter . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored a team - leading var_player[0][0][PTS] points while also grabbing var_player[0][0][AST] rebounds in the defeat . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] played a great defensive game , as he tallied var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][OREB] blocks and var_player[0][2][PF] steals in the loss . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] wo n't play again until the 19th when they take on the Washington Wizards after the All-Star break .
It 's been a rough stretch of var_player[1][0][STL] games over the last var_player[1][0][AST] days for var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] - - by his standards - - after he got off to a scorching hot start to the month of March . Following his var_player[1][0][PTS] - point performance ( var_team[0][TEAM-AST] of which came in the second half ) in Tuesday 's comeback victory over the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] has now failed to score at least 25 points in each of his last var_player[1][0][DREB] games after hitting that total in var_player[1][0][FGM] of his var_player[1][0][FTM] previous games . The All-Star also has n't been shooting the ball at an efficient rate as of late , with Tuesday 's 54 percent performance from the field being his best since last Wednesday when he hit 57 percent of his shots in a loss to Portland . In the var_player[1][0][PF] games in between , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] shot a combined 9 - of - 27 ( 30 percent ) from the field , which was easily his worst var_player[1][0][PF] - game shooting stretch of the season .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is on a two - game win streak . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists for a double - double . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] got in on the fun off the bench , scoring a team - high var_player[0][6][PTS] points in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . Both teams struggled to put the ball in the basket . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , but they gained an advantage by holding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to an even worse var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost two straight and ten of their last 11 games . They had just var_player[1][1][FG3A] players score in double figures Saturday , with var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] scoring a team - high var_player[1][1][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists . Starting center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] continues to struggle in his return from a sprained ankle . He got into foul trouble Saturday that limited him to zero points and five rebounds in 24 minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will finish their road trip against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been a different team this season and dominating wins like this show their improvement . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had a one - point lead early in the first quarter , but that marked their only lead of the game . Three-point shooting really killed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as they went 5 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went 9 - of - 20 from long range . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's best player , as he tallied var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points and var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds en route to a double - double . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was n't far behind , as he accrued var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][DREB] assists . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to score var_player[1][7][PTS] points a piece for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench outmatched that though , as they got var_player[0][7][AST] assists from var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and a monster var_player[0][5][PTS] - point , var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - rebound double - double from var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters in scoring , as he dropped var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the Barclays Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continued their strong play of late , recording their second straight win and seventh of their last ten . Despite the loss , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] actually were the superior shooters in this one , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . What may have been the deciding factor were free throws though . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] converted on 17 - of - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot just 11 and converted on only four of those 11 attempts . As has been the case for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] all season , both var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] did the bulk of the work offensively . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with a team - high of var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) , while adding var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][STL] steals as well .

He went 5 - for - 6 from the field and a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 14 points , while adding four assists as well . The only other var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] player to reach double - digit points was var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who came off the bench for var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][REB] - var_player[1][5][FGM] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][5][AST] assists in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] really struggled to score in this one , with just three players reaching double figures in points . One of those players was var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who took over the starting center spot for var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] , as var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] was put back into a bench role . In 35 minutes , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FG3_PCT] - var_player[0][2][TO] 3Pt , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][DREB] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][STL] blocked shots . It was his second double - double in a row , as he 's combined for 38 points and 23 rebounds over that span . He 's now averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds on the season . Along with var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also moved into the starting lineup Sunday , pushing var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] to the bench . He matched a team - high with 19 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) , while also adding three rebounds and four steals in 32 minutes . With such a strong performance , he should continue to start for the forseeable future . Coming off the bench , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][6][PTS] points ( var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][6][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][FG3M] - var_player[0][6][FGM] 3Pt ) in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes .

The game remained close through var_player[0][1][AST] quarters , as the return of var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who was out with an Achilles injury , kept the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in the game . However , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dominated the fourth quarter , winning the period var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - 19 and pulling away . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] continues to lead the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to start the season , as he finished with a game - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points on an efficient var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] added a double - double of var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in just var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] fell just short of a double - double , recording var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][DREB] rebounds in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] returned in a big way , recording var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes , but shot just var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the field . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] played every minute at point guard and recorded var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , but also committed var_player[0][4][TO] turnovers . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] managed to contribute var_player[0][5][PTS] and var_player[0][6][PTS] points respectively off the bench .

Meanwhile , on var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's end , it was var_player[0][8][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] , Jr. who posted var_player[0][8][PTS] points off the bench . His 26 - foot three - point jumper with var_player[1][0][FGM] seconds remaining in regulation knotted the game at 100 , and var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's missed 14 - foot shot as time expired insured a fifth quarter . var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] drained var_player[0][8][FTA] more three - pointers early and a key free throw late in the extra period , and var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] missed a driving layup at the buzzer , helping the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) escape with a hard - fought win . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , six assists and var_player[1][1][BLK] rebounds behind var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a near double - double with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][AST] assists , a steal and a block . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists , a steal and a block . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] led the second unit with var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][STL] rebounds , var_player[1][8][AST] assists and var_player[1][8][PF] steals . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][OREB] assists and a block . var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] supplemented his point total with var_player[0][8][REB] rebounds and an assist . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][FG3A] rebounds and a block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][FG3M] assists , a steal and a block in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] notably underwhelmed on the starting five , combining for just 17 points overall . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head to Orlando for a Wednesday night date with the Magic .
var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up their play after var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] left the game with a right hamstring injury , and the sharp shooting and rebounding on display by both starters were able to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] comeback attempts at bay . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[0][0][AST] assists and var_player[0][0][REB] rebound . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] also buried a trio of three pointers , in addition to finishing var_player[0][0][FTM] - of - var_player[0][0][FTA] from the free throw line . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] notched his 11th triple - double of the season , which ties him with Andre_Drummond for seventh in the NBA .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . With just under var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] seconds left in the game , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was able to hit a jump shot , putting the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] up by var_player[0][3][DREB] . On the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] next posession , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] attempted to drive to the hoop , but got blocked by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got the ball back after the block , and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][4][FG3M] more shot to win the game , but he missed a var_player[1][4][DREB] - pointer at the buzzer , giving the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] the close var_player[1][4][PF] - point victory in front of their home crowd . While the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent ) shot better than the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] from the field ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent ) , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took the advantage from the three - point line , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went just var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent . Along with the go - ahead bucket that helped give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a victory , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] also posted var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTA] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][3][STL] rebounds and var_player[0][3][STL] steals in the victory . He 's on an impressive stretch of three games where he 's averaging 22 points , five rebounds and 3 steals per game .

His points totals were down , but with var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] playing so well , he did n't have to do as much offensively . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[0][9][PTS] points ( var_player[0][9][DREB] - var_player[0][9][FGA] FG , var_player[0][9][FG3M] - var_player[0][9][FG3A] 3PT ) in just 18 minutes as well . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , but just could n't come up clutch in the final moments . He finished with 21 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) , four rebounds and eight assists . He shot only 30 percent ( 3 - 10 FG ) from the field in Monday 's game against the Magic , so it was nice to see some improvement with his shot . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] also played a factor , going var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][0][FTA] - for - var_player[1][0][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][0][PTS] points . After combining for just eight points over his last two games , he was much more efficient with his time Wednesday . var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] had a solid showing , posting var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][1][STL] rebounds and var_player[1][1][STL] steals .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , on Wednesday night at the Air Canada Centre to take a var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] built a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] cushion after one quarter that the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] spent the majority of game trying to chip away at , but ultimately , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] kept pulling away just enough to ultimately secure the victory . The contest was a costly one for both teams health - wise , but particularly for a var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] squad that was already short - handed coming in . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had to exit the game after var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes due to a left wrist injury , completing the decimation of a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] frontcourt that previously lost Chris_Bosh ( clots ) and Hassan_Whiteside ( knee ) . Meanwhile , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] mirrored var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's misfortune , leaving with his own left wrist contusion after var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did n't exactly escape unscathed either , as he appeared to reaggravate the thumb injury that he originally suffered in Game var_player[0][3][FG3A] . However , the standout two - guard finished the game and did n't allow the ailment to slow him , as he scored a team - leading 34 points and added four rebounds , two assists and two steals . The performance featured a perfect 11 - for - 11 effort from the free - throw line , with several of the baskets coming in the game 's final minutes to help stave off a comeback by the visitors . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points , along with var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and a block . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who appeared to come up limping after a change of possession late in the fourth quarter , was next with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and a pair of dimes . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and an assist . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block over var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who both stand to see an uptick in playing time if var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] is forced to miss a do - or - die Game var_player[1][7][PTS] , tallied var_player[1][7][PTS] points and var_player[1][7][REB] boards apiece off the bench . The former also added a steal . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] may have played second fiddle in terms of scoring to his talented backcourt mate , but drained several key buckets in the final var_player[0][4][PF] minutes to secure the win . He finished with 25 points , 10 rebounds , six assists , three steals and a block . Although he only managed to net nine of his 25 shot attempts , he did sink four of his nine tries from beyond the arc , including a 25 - footer with 52 seconds remaining . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] acquitted himself well in his second start in Jonas_Valanciunas ' ( ankle ) stead , tallying var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][FTM] steals and var_player[0][2][TO] blocks . He scored two for the other team as well , as he was called for goal tending late in the fourth quarter . Corey var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][AST] assists , a rebound and var_player[0][6][STL] steals . The var_player[0][0][FG3A] teams reconvene down in South Florida for a pivotal Game var_player[1][1][REB] on Friday night at American Airlines Arena , with the respective statuses of var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] currently up in the air .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday . var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] was given an off day for only the second time this season and unfortunately for the Cavs , the results of his absence were somewhat predictable . The final margin of victory for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] belied their game - long dominance of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , who was already staring at a 96 - 70 deficit heading into the final period . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's first unit unsurprisingly bested var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's starting five in all major categories , and only var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] appeared determined to try and keep the game respectable for the short - handed visitors . The victory was a crucial one for a var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] squad that needs every win it can get down the stretch , and the comfortable second - half lead allowed their front - line players some much needed rest . All five members of the first unit were able to play under var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] minutes for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , a welcome luxury in the latter stages of what has been a tough season for them to date . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] points spearheaded var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's attack on the afternoon , and the game - high scoring total was supplemented by var_player[1][4][FTM] assists and a rebound . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a distant second with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and an assist in just var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes of play . Veteran var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] drew the start in var_player[1][11][FIRST_NAME] ' place , and contributed var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] boards and an assist . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][STL] points , var_player[1][2][FTA] rebounds , var_player[1][3][STL] assists ) and J.R. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FGM] rebounds , an assist and var_player[1][2][DREB] steals ) were underwhelming while rounding out a generally forgettable afternoon for the Cavs ' first unit . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] contributed a var_player[1][8][REB] - point , var_player[1][8][REB] - rebound double - double off the bench to pace the reserves . Despite the defeat , the Cavs continue atop the Eastern Conference Central Division and also possess the first seed in the conference by one and a half games over the Toronto Raptors , who can make up some ground by defeating the Detroit Pistons later Sunday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] heads back home to face off against the Indiana Pacers on Monday evening . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds in just var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] encouragingly matched var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's point total and added var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists and a block . It was notably only the second performance of over 20 points for the struggling forward in February , and first since Feb. 6 versus the Hornets . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] contributed a near double - double with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][OREB] assists and a block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , still coming off the bench , poured in var_player[0][5][PTS] points and added var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals to pace the reserves .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday . The high - octane var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got a bit more than they likely bargained for from a game var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] squad , beginning in the second period . After var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] jumped out to a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] lead after the first 12 minutes , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] answered with a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - point second quarter in which they outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] by var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] .

The one blemish on his otherwise stellar outing was the six turnovers he committed . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , var_player[1][3][FTM] steals and a block . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with a pair of var_player[1][6][PTS] - point efforts , with var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] adding var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] registering var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][FG3A] assists . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] remains atop the Western Conference 's Northwest Division .

He also supplied seven rebounds , three assists , two steals and a block . However , like var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] was also guilty of handing the ball to the opposition on var_player[1][4][TO] occasions . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued his solid play as the starting point guard , managing var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][PF] boards . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] amassed var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][TO] assists and var_player[0][0][STL] steals , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] boards and a block . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] reserves with var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points , and also added an assist . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had a near double - double off the bench as well , registering var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] boards , var_player[0][5][STL] assists , var_player[0][5][STL] steals and a block .

They 're at home again Wednesday for another tussle with a high - powered offense , as the reigning champion Golden_State Warriors come to town .
While the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been struggling after their shockingly impressive start to the regular season , there is a silver lining in the form of rookie forward var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] . The rookie struggled to acquiesce to the speed and strength of the NBA to start his career , but since the start of the new year , var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] has begun to produce on a consistent level . After his var_player[0][5][PTS] - point performance Tuesday against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] is now averaging 14 points over his last var_player[0][5][REB] games and has scored in double - digits in each of those contests . Additionally , he has now shot at least 50 percent from the field in five straight games . This stretch comes after var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] reached double - digit scoring in just eight games all season , as it appears the rookie is growing more and more comfortable in the big leagues with every game played .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were the better shooting team in this one , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . Along with the shooting advantage , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also out - rebounded the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] , helping them edge the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with a three point victory . As has been the case for the majority of the season , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] relied on their starting backcourt for their offensive production . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , as he was able to shoot var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][4][AST] from the three - point line . After recording only eight points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday , this performance was a nice bounce back game for him . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a solid contribution of his own , scoring var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][BLK] - var_player[0][3][TO] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][DREB] FT ) , while adding var_player[0][3][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . He 's had the hot hand of late , as he 's averaging 23 points over his last four games . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also saw their bench chip in as var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[0][6][PTS] points ( var_player[0][6][TO] - var_player[0][6][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][FG3M] - var_player[0][6][FGM] 3Pt ) . While he really struggled with his shot from the field , he forced his way to the line all game , converting on a perfect 10 - of - 10 from the free throw line . J.J. var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] recorded a double - double off the bench with var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FTA] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FTM] - var_player[0][5][FGM] FT ) and var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds as well . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took advantage of var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' starting center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who is in his rookie season and was forced into the starting lineup after var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] was traded to the Cavaliers . They fed the ball to var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] all night , who finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][DREB] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . It was his second 20 - point performance in a row , along with his second double - double in as many games . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong night offensively . He went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 17 points , while also recording six assists . He also added three steals , after posting four on Sunday against the Charlotte Hornets . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] stayed productive . He went 4 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from beyond the arc to score 14 points in 18 minutes . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] did n't have the offensive numbers he 's come accustomed to this year , as he finished with only var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][DREB] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][BLK] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Los_Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday .

Through the season 's first two games , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] could n't seem to find the bottom of the net , shooting just var_player[0][4][FTM] - for - var_player[0][4][PTS] from the fiedl . Backcourt mate var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , was playing like a man fully deserving of the $ 139 million commitment the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][3][OREB] - var_player[0][3][TO] ) made in him this past offseason . Monday , it all came together for the talented guard duo , as they combined for a 62 - point tally to spearhead var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] in a victory that was in doubt until the final buzzer . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's last - gasp three - point heave nearly found the basket as the clock hit double zeros , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] averted overtime and won their second home game in var_player[1][0][FGM] tries . A trio of var_player[1][3][PTS] - point efforts from var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] paced the scoring output for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][REB] ) on the night . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] did a lot of his damage from the free - throw line , where he converted all var_player[1][0][FTM] attempts , and was just var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was dominant down low , notching var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , an assist , var_player[1][2][FGM] blocks and a steal .

He finished with 10 points , 13 rebounds , five assists , four blocks , two steals and just two late fouls when the game was already seemingly out of hand for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who started in place on Paul , finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][FG3M] steals in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] quietly had a good game with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] boards , var_player[1][5][DREB] assists and var_player[1][5][PF] steals . However , like many players in this game , was bit by the turnover bug . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][5][TO] of his teams var_player[1][5][PTS] turnovers . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had a 13 - point in the first lead but could n't hold on , even without Paul in the opposing lineup . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's lead shrank to just four points at halftime . They kept it close for a little while but var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to skip away slowly and won the game going away . With plenty of hack - a - whoever to go around in this var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to win both the third and fourth quarters by 10 points each , and now hold a 10 lead in the series to go along with homecourt advantage . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] learned Monday that Stephen_Curry won the MVP . He had a solid game with 20 points , 12 assists , five rebounds and four steals . Unfortunately for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , he also had nine costly turnovers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Oracle Arena on Monday . The most anticipated matchup of the season resulted in a surprising 30 - point rout in favor of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The first of four regular season matchups between the NBA 's two best teams started off shaky for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they converted eight turnovers in the first quarter , and never truly recovered over the next three periods . The turnovers started at the expense of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , the 15 year veteran who uncharacteristically made bad passes , was out played by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] on the defensive end . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was eventually switched to guard the reigning MVP , but was as unsuccessful as var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] in trying to slow down var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring and finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting , to go along with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] started in place of Tim_Duncan ( knee ) , and also finished in double - figures with var_player[1][2][PTS] points . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was unable to get comfortable in the post , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] faced difficulty getting space and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was equally ineffective from behind the arc and on the drive . The loss snapped a 13 game winning streak for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce back when they host the Houston Rockets ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - 22 ) on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did not disappoint in their own arena , and were more impressive on the defensive end of the floor as compared to their high powered offense . While var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] dropped var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] points , they harassed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and forced 26 turnovers which led to an early first half lead , in which they did not let go of the rest of the game . The quickness of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] offense caused constant mismatches , especially in the paint after the drive , where var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] was the first to wreck havoc in transition . var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][8][PTS] points were mostly seen in the second quarter . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was far from quiet and started to heat up where var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] left off , as he scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting , including var_player[0][8][FGM] three - pointers in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] commanded the offense during many of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] possessions , as a result , he rounded out the box score with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . Six var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] players finished in double figures with no one player going for more than 28 minutes , as the lead in the fourth quarter was comfortable enough to run the reserves . The win marks the fourth straight for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Dallas Mavericks ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) , one of the only teams to beat them this season , on Wednesday .
var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] spearheaded var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to their 10th straight win with a monstrous var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench totaled 50 points . They also posted outstanding 59 and 55 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively , allowing them to overcome 20 turnovers . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] followed var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[0][3][PTS] points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's point total to lead the bench . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] were productive as reserves as well , tallying var_player[0][7][PTS] and var_player[0][6][PTS] points , respectively . The Sixers were led by var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted var_player[1][1][PTS] points . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] followed with a near double - double consisting of var_player[1][3][FGA] points and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds . T.J.McConnell generated 11 points , while Sean var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[1][7][PTS] points as a reserve .
There were 12 ties and 13 lead changes , as this game came down to the final seconds . In fact , no team led by more than 10 points in the tightly contested game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] took much better care of the ball than var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as they recorded var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists to just var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] turnovers . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on the other hand , committed var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , while assisting on just var_team[0][TEAM-AST] buckets . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] were able to prevail , despite being outrebounded , 50 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] once again , as they combined for 54 points and var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] backcourt of var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did everything they could to match that , as they combined for 60 points , var_player[0][3][FTM] rebounds and var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] assists . The other six starters combined for just 46 points , as those four superstars were leaned on heavily in this matchup . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] were nice sparks off the bench , as var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] dropped var_player[1][6][PTS] for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][6][PTS] for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] .
In a down - to - the - wire game , the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were able to pull out a win against the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) , finishing up var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is now in the Eastern Conference playoff picture , and the win against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] marks the team 's fourth straight . Center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was a difference - maker for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , recording a team - high var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes and an var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] seemed to ride var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's hot hand all night , as he took a game - high var_player[1][2][FGA] shots . The game also marked the continuation of shooting guard var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] 's new role as a sixth man , a change that seems to have benefited var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's rotations . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] followed up a 19 - point outing off the bench against Boston with var_player[1][6][PTS] points tonight to go with var_player[1][6][PF] rebounds , var_player[1][6][PF] assists , and var_player[1][6][STL] steals . All in all , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] appear to be clicking , as they now have a substantial win streak and sit two games above .500 . For the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , the close loss saw some unorthodox rotations from coach Sam Mitchell . As rookie center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] struggled from the field ( var_player[0][2][BLK] - for - var_player[0][2][FGA] ) , backup big man var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] stepped in to play a season - high var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] looked solid defensively , recording var_player[0][6][BLK] blocks and a steal while also playing efficient offense , tallying var_player[0][6][PTS] points on var_player[0][6][FGM] - of - var_player[0][6][FGA] shooting . The Louisville alum has seen a steady uptick in minutes recently , and with his elevated play , this could be a continuing trend in the crowded var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] frontcourt . With four straight wins under their belt , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will hope to extend the streak even further as they face the Jazz on Thursday . Meanwhile , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce back on Saturday as they prepare to square off against Portland .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . Playing on the second night of a home - and - home back - to - back between these two teams , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into Saturday 's game looking for revenge after they took a beating at the hands of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 107 - 77 on Friday , and they got their revenge . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] jumped out to a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 10 lead after the first quarter . They gave up most of their lead in the second quarter but had enough to hang on for the win . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] paced the team with a game - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes , indicating that he is probably over his hamstring injury . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot a putrid var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field but were able to secure the win by holding the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to an unremarkable var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and by getting 32 easy points on var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers by the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was playing without var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] ( concussion ) and var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( illness ) , leaving them inadequately supplied to deal with the strength and skill of var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] found success off the bench , putting up a team - high var_player[0][6][PTS] points in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will continue their road trip against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Barclays Center on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came in to Wednesday riding a var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - 1 record , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] sported a 1 - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] mark that seemed indicative of their lack of offensive firepower . However , a pair of standout efforts from var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] on the first unit and var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_player[0][9][PF] - var_player[0][9][AST] ) to the upset victory and stellar var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were also superior around the basket , as they outrebounded the visitors by a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] margin , with 40 of those boards on the defensive end . They also outscored var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_player[1][2][BLK] ) 50 - 34 in the paint , while holding standout big man var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] to a season - low var_player[1][2][REB] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . The reliable duo of var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] co - led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with a pair of var_player[1][0][PTS] - point efforts , with the former adding var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][TO] assists and var_player[1][1][STL] steals and the latter also supplying var_player[1][0][FG3A] boards , an assist and a steal . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other member of the starting var_player[1][3][FTA] with double - digit scoring , totaling var_player[1][3][PTS] points and also registering var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][3][PF] steals . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] continued his strong work off the bench in the early going this season , compiling var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][PF] blocks , while fellow veteran var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][AST] assists , a rebound and a steal . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] exploded for a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double to lead the way for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , and added an assist , a steal and a block . The versatile big man went 12 - of - 21 from the field and also impressively drained half of his eight long - range tries . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] collected var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FGM] rebounds and a pair of assists , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] assists and a pair of boards . var_player[0][9][SECOND_NAME] led the bench with a season - high var_player[0][9][PTS] points and var_player[0][9][REB] rebounds while also dishing out var_player[0][9][AST] assists and recording var_player[0][9][PF] steals . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] was also strong in a reserve capacity , contributing a var_player[0][6][PTS] - point effort . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face off with the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain in the Empire State to tangle with the Hornets on Friday evening .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , on Monday . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had his second - best scoring performance of the season with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points with var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . Starting in place of Steven_Adams , who recently had surgery on his fractured hand , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] played var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes , recording var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][FGM] rebounds . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] followed up his 19 - point , var_player[1][7][REB] - rebound performance from Sunday with var_player[1][7][PTS] points and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds . He did n't play more than 25 minutes in either game but could be a force going forward with var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] underproducing and Adams out for a few weeks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are slipping fast . They are 1 - 13 since winning five straight in early January . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] put up var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , but it was n't nearly enough to overcome var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's hot shooting night . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] steals . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was without var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( illness ) and Jameer_Nelson ( Achilles ) , who were both questionable going into Monday 's game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are now nine - and - a - half games back from the final playoff spot in the Western Conference . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Grizzlies in Memphis on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Los_Angeles to play the Lakers on Tuesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played a very strange game on Wednesday , as both teams shot terribly , but did n't make many mistakes . In fact , Both teams shot below 40 percent from the field and the two teams combined for just 18 turnovers . Defense was clearly the focus for both teams , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] failed to record a fast - break point all game long . There were very little differences in the stat sheet and it simply came down to the fact that the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's bench signicantly outplayed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] bench . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] got 43 bench points to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 12 and that proved to be the difference . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into this game as one of the hottest teams in the league , but struggled offensively in this matchup . This Scott Skiles defense stifled the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , despite the fact that var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored season - highs in points . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] had his best game of the season statistically speaking , as he tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points and 13 rebounds in the loss . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] also had his best game in years , as he totaled 25 points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds in the defeat . It was the `` others `` who killed this team though , as no other player scored more than 10 points in the loss . It 's clear that this team plays better when var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] takes less shots and that was the fact yet again on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will play the Miami Heat on Friday in their next scheduled game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] made a strange move by relegating var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] to the bench , but that proved to work wonders here . It 's unclear if it lit a fire under him or that he just played better in the second unit , but var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[0][5][FG3M] of his best games of the season in that role . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] scored a team - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points off the bench and did that damage in just var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] all recorded double - doubles as well , and this was var_player[0][0][FG3M] of the best all - around team efforts the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have had all season . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to play like this again when they take on the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) extended their winning streak to var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] games Monday night , knocking off the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at the Staples Center . It was the second loss in as many nights for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who fell to Portland 107 - 93 on Sunday . The Wolves were led Monday by second - year swingman var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[1][5][PTS] points to go with var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][5][AST] assists in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][FIRST_NAME] Lavine had var_player[1][9][PTS] and var_player[1][7][PTS] points , respectively , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the only starter in double - figures with var_player[1][0][PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent as a team and was out - rebounded 50 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][FGM] rebounds from var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who converted var_player[0][1][FTA] - of - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] field goal attempts . J.J. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][3][PTS] points of his own , and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had an var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] rebound double - double . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] provided a solid var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes off the bench , knocking down var_player[0][7][REB] threes en route to var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][FG3M] rebounds and var_player[0][7][AST] assists . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] play host to the winless 76ers on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home and will face the Magic , also on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) held on for a road victory Thursday over the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) at the Smoothie King Center , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . Despite var_player[1][4][OREB] of var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] 's worst shooting games as a professional — var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] , including var_player[1][4][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from three - point land — the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] held on and extended their winning streak to var_player[1][1][PTS] games . After trailing for most of the first half , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took a 50 - 48 lead late in the second quarter and trailed only for 17 seconds in the second half as they managed to stave off a late but futile var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] run . J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's hot shooting night , including var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] from three - point land , gave him var_player[1][3][PTS] points to lead all scorers . var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] still scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points , grabbed var_player[1][1][PTS] rebounds and dished out var_player[1][4][AST] assists despite his awful shooting night . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was a monster on the glass , as he grabbed var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds — including var_player[1][2][OREB] on the offensive end — and scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points as he owned the paint in Blake Griffin 's absence . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had six players finish in double figures , but var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was the only var_player[0][7][FG3M] to find his groove , as he led the club with var_player[0][7][PTS] points on an efficient var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] Evens scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points each and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][1][REB] , but none managed to shoot var_player[0][5][FG3_PCT] percent from the floor .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday . The new - look var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[1][2][BLK] - var_player[0][0][FTM] ) , who added var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] in a makeover of their starting var_player[1][2][DREB] this offseason , had their moments at various points until the middle of the third quarter , at which point var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and rest of the defending NBA champions started to exert their dominance . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's comeback efforts were ultimately undermined by a collectively poor shooting night , vulnerability down in the paint despite the presence of var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] and standout second - year forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , and carelessness with the ball . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] managed just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field , was out - rebounded on the defensive glass by a 40 - 29 margin , was outscored 52 - 28 in the paint , and allowed 21 points to the Cavs off var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , all pivotal factors in a 29 - point defeat . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who played only var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes in the blowout but managed var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points , var_player[1][0][PF] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and a steal . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] put together a var_player[1][4][PTS] - point effort in his var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] debut after missing most of the preseason , but could only supplement the scoring with var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , an assist and a block . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] was solid with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , a steal and a pair of rejections , with more than half his scoring coming on var_player[1][1][FG3M] made three - pointers on var_player[1][1][FG3A] attempts . However , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] were shut out on the scoreboard altogether , with the former making up somewhat for his lack of points with var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][AST] assists and a steal in a modest var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . The decisive second - half lead the Cavs ( 10 ) eventually built up allowed their two biggest superstars to finish the last several minutes on the bench . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , often matched up against a rusty var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , paced the Cavs with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FG3M] assists , var_player[1][4][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FG3A] steals . var_player[0][12][FIRST_NAME] posted a triple - double , totaling var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FGA] assists , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and a block in just var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] contributed a double - double with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FTA] boards , a pair of assists and a trio of steals .

var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot a respectable var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] percent from the field and committed a relatively modest var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , but var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] took the reins of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] offense with a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - point , var_player[1][4][AST] - assist , var_player[1][4][OREB] - rebound , var_player[1][4][OREB] - steal performance over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes .

Second-year var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had several breakout performances during his rookie campaign after starter Ricky_Rubio went down for the season . Early in the 2015 - 16 campaign var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] has once again benefited from Rubio 's injury troubles , and only foul trouble hindered him Sunday from potentially posting his best day as pro . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] tallied an incredible var_player[0][4][PTS] points in just var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes of court time , shooting var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field , including var_player[0][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from three - point range . The scoring was var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's second highest total of the season , and would have shattered his high - water mark of 26 points had his time on the court not been curtailed . Another pair of dynamic young var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and 2015 first overall pick var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , stepped up offensively in their own right to lead var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] amassed var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][FGA] points , var_player[0][2][REB] boards ) came within a rebound short of a double - double for the second straight game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also enjoyed an extremely balanced effort from their bench , with var_player[0][7][FTM] players ( var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] ) all pitching with var_player[0][7][PTS] - point efforts . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell to 5 - 5 and reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They now head to Miami for a Tuesday tilt versus the Heat . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] received a much - needed offensive boost from a somewhat unlikely source Sunday , as var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] reentered the starting lineup with rousing success . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] poured in var_player[1][3][PTS] points over a season - high var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes on impressive var_player[1][6][REB] - of - var_player[1][6][PTS] shooting . Meanwhile , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued to claw back from the low point of his season , a var_player[1][4][FTA] - point , var_player[1][4][TO] - of - 12 shooting performance last Wednesday versus the Warriors . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] tallied his first var_player[1][4][PTS] - point effort since Nov. var_player[1][4][AST] , and chipped in var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals . Frontcourt mates var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had strong games of their own , with var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] holding his own against the rookie sensation var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] to the tune of var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][2][FTA] assists , and a pair of blocks . Even new acquisition var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] got into the act , pitching in var_player[1][7][PTS] points off the bench over var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes for his best game yet in a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] uniform . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] also represented the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] reserves well , with a var_player[1][6][PTS] - point outing . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] improved to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and resides in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home for a date with the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Monday .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to keep their playoff hopes alive with the win over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The New_Orleans Pelicans also came out with a win on Monday , so both the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and Pelicans remain tied for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the West . The Pelicans own the tiebreaker though , so in order for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to get into the playoffs , they 'll need a win of their own , as well as a Pelican 's loss on Wednesday in the finale . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , on the other hand , have locked up the fourth seed in the West . It 's still up in the air who they 'll end up having to play , but it could be either the San_Antonio Spurs , Houston Rockets , Memphis Grizzlies or Los_Angeles Clippers . Despite finishing with worse shooting percentages than the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came out with a huge advantage on the boards , out - rebounding them var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . It was the duo of var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] who helped keep the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in playoff contention . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a game - high of var_player[0][4][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . He 's been absolutely phenomenal throughout the whole second half of this season and he continues to put all the pressure on his own shoulders here in the final stretch , as he 's averaging a ridiculous 39 points , 7 rebounds and 7 assists over his last three games . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][REB] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][AST] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][1][FGM] rebounds over var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] has scored over var_player[0][1][FGA] points in five of his last var_player[0][1][DREB] games , a var_player[0][1][DREB] - game stretch where he 's averaging 21 points . var_player[0][3][FIRST_NAME] waiters ( var_player[0][3][AST] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][TO] - var_player[0][3][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FG3M] - var_player[0][5][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][OREB] - var_player[0][5][FTA] FT ) were the only other var_player[0][3][PF] players in double figures with var_player[0][3][PTS] and var_player[0][5][PTS] points respectively . Already heavily hit by the injury bug , this was another damaging game for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as both var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] had to leave the game with injuries . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] went down with a nasty looking ankle injury , while var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's leg appeared to buckle as he went down with a knee injury . It 's an awful amount of bad luck for this var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' team , who could now go into the playoffs very shorthanded . With var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] also sitting this game out due to a foot injury , it was var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] who led this team while in the starting lineup . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] posted a season - high of var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FG3A] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][FTA] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , while also adding var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and a blocked shot over var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . He 'll go into the season finale averaging 6 points and 5 rebounds in his second season as a pro . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did n't have his best showing of the season , posting just var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][PF] - var_player[1][4][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in the loss . After going off for var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points in Saturday 's game against the Jazz , it was a disappointing performance for var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , who will need to play much better in the playoffs if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] want any shot at making it past the first round . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][5][MIN] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG ) and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds off the bench , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG ) and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's final game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Wednesday .

In a game between two struggling teams , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] could n't quite keep up in their fourth game in var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] nights . That was clearly evident late , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ended the game on a 17 - 5 run to pull off the comeback . While the defense struggled all night , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] held var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to just var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points in the fourth quarter , while scoring var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points on their end . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] offense was on point , as they shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and recorded var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists in the victory . Rebounding was key as well , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] winning that battle , var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 31 . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) rode one of their best offensive performances here to an impressive road win . While no player on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had more than 21 points , they had six players score at least 14 . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , tallying var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points and grabbed var_player[1][2][REB] boards on var_player[1][2][REB] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting in just 20 minutes of action . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was huge off the bench , dropping var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][FGA] rebounds on var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][5][REB] from the field . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and Juancho var_player[1][9][SECOND_NAME] each scored var_player[1][9][PTS] a piece off the bench . On deck for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] is a road matchup against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday . . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had to play this game without Nikola_Vucevic and it clearly hurt their defense . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did all he could against his former team , as he led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was n't far behind , accumulating var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][BLK] rebounds and var_player[0][1][REB] blocks in the defeat . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] was questionable coming in to this game with an ankle injury , but provided var_player[0][6][PTS] points off the bench . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next game is on Tuesday in a road matchup against the Atlanta Hawks .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , 97 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Amway Center on Saturday . In a battle between two inept offenses , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to prevail with a much - needed victory . They took care of business late , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 31 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] in the fourth quarter . Defense was key for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as they held var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and dominated the rebounding , var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] not only controlled the paint through rebounding , as they outscored var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 32 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] in the paint as well . No team led by more than nine points , as this was tightly - contested throughout . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) is in a historically bad stretch offensively right now and a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] percent night just adds to those struggles . Newly-acquired , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , was the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] best player , as he tallied var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][6][AST] assists off the bench . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the starters in scoring , as they scored var_player[1][3][PTS] apiece . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] went just var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field , en route to an var_player[1][0][PTS] - point night . The offensive struggles are likely to continue , as they travel to San_Antonio on Monday to face the Spurs for their next game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has been just as bad on offense as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , but they were able to win here thanks to some elite defense . D.J . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] led the team in scoring , totaling var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][AST] assists off the bench . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was second in scoring , tallying var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][OREB] blocks in the win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] amassed var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , despite going var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] from the field . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double off the bench , accruing var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][BLK] blocks in the win . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to keep rolling , as they travel to Milwaukee on Monday to face the Bucks .
var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's 29 - point first half is easily his best performance of the season , but it 's even better when you consider he single - handedly outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the second quarter . The 39 points was a season - high and the seven made threes tied a career - high . While var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] failed to reach double figures in scoring , their combined 20 rebounds , var_player[0][2][PF] steals and seven blocks played a huge factor on the other end of the floor . Despite leading the team with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] provided just var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds , no assists and no steals or blocks in the blowout loss . That led to his - 25 plus - minus , which was one of the worst for the game . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] talked a lot to var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] during the loss , but did almost all of it from the bench . In fact , he failed to score or rebound and played just three minutes in the defeat . Things should get better for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] though , as they start a five - game homestand on Saturday and play three teams in that stretch expected to finish below .500 . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also have a nice five - game stretch approaching , as their next five games come against teams who failed to miss the playoffs last season .
var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] has been seen as a legitimate MVP candidate in this young NBA season with his ability to stuff the stat sheet with points , assists and rebounds . He has , however , also managed to stuff it with turnovers as of late , especially when his assist number is high . In his last var_player[0][4][FG3M] games with at least var_player[0][4][AST] assists - - var_player[0][4][BLK] of which happened in Wednesday night 's loss - - var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] has also posted at least var_player[0][4][FG3A] turnovers . The 12 turnovers he had Wednesday was his season high and the first time he reached double - digit turnovers this season . For the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , their MVP candidate var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had another strong , var_player[1][3][PTS] - point performance , but did n't come as easy as the box score may indicate . An astonishing 21 of of his var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points came in the third quarter Wednesday night , as he managed to score 11 straight points for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] at one point in the period . He 's managed to keep his scoring average above 30 points , now at 31 points per game after Wednesday 's performance .

The aptly - named Greek Freak led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds , four assists , a steal and three blocks . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] posted a near double - double off the bench with var_player[1][6][PTS] points and var_player[1][6][REB] boards . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] went for var_player[1][3][PTS] , and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was productive in a reserve role as well , generating var_player[1][5][PTS] points . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][REB] - rebound double - double led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] checked in with var_player[0][3][PTS] . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] mustered a modest var_player[0][2][PTS] points but hauled in var_player[0][2][REB] boards . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[0][5][PTS] points .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) edged the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at FedEx Forum on Friday . Coming off an overtime loss to the Nets on Wednesday , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] jumped out of the blocks and were never headed after var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] got the first bucket of the night . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points before leaving the game due to a hamstring strain , of which the severity is unknown at this point . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] accumulated the fourth triple - double of his illustrious career , scoring var_player[1][1][PTS] points with var_player[1][1][AST] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] also added var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks to his impressive stat line . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's hot streak continued , pouring in var_player[1][3][PTS] points , including var_player[1][3][DREB] three - pointers , bringing his recent tally to 17 made three - pointers in his last var_player[1][3][FG3A] games . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] face off against the Timberwolves back home in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] on Saturday . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] pushed through the bone bruise on his knee to lead the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in scoring , ending the game with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] blocks . He was ably assisted by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who had var_player[0][4][PTS] points of his own , along with var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] turned back the clock , joining var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[0][2][FGA] points , including hitting all var_player[0][5][FG3M] of his attempts from behind the three - point line . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had been undefeated at home before coming up against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , and have now lost two consecutive games for the first time this season . They will try to right the ship Sunday against the visiting Miami Heat .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took down the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on the road at the Air Canada Centre on Thursdsay night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] look to be the part of a serious contender to this point , and beating a strong team like the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on the road just proves that . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by an impressive team effort , and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted yet another double - double with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] FG , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FTM] blocks , var_player[1][1][OREB] assists and var_player[1][1][STL] steal . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] also had a huge game , playing a total of var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes and producing in a big way , scoring var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][TO] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][AST] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) with var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][FTM] assists and var_player[1][3][TO] block .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 20 ) took a 20 lead in their opening round series with the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Tuesday with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] victory at the Quicken Loans Arena . Unlike in Game 1 where var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] could n't hang with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] for all 48 minutes , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hung close with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] for the entirety of Tuesday 's Game var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had a chance to cut the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' lead to var_player[1][2][DREB] with just under var_player[1][2][FTA] minutes remaining , but var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's jumper was blocked by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] proceeded to run the clock down thanks to some timely offensive rebounding from var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . During the game , var_player[0][9][FIRST_NAME] passed Jerry West for 7th on the all - time postseason scoring list . The series will head to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for Game 3 on Thursday , where var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to avoid a nearly insurmountable 30 deficit . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] battled throughout , but was ultimately unable to steal a game on the road . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was an offensive catalyst off the bench with var_player[1][5][PTS] points to lead the team in scoring . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] also managed to get to the line with some frequency , going var_player[1][5][FTA] - for - var_player[1][5][FTM] from the charity stripe . The only other Celtic with more than var_player[1][0][FG3A] free throw attempts was var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who was var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FTA] . There were some positives on the defensive end for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , however , as it forced var_team[0][TEAM-AST] turnovers and held var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] percent from beyond the arc . If var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] can match that effort again on the defensive end in Game 3 , it will give the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] a shot to extend the series to at least Game 5 . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's stars were the story once again as var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 56 of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] points . That said , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] 's impact off the bench can not be understated . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , with var_player[0][5][DREB] of those boards coming on the offensive end . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was also effective before fouling out with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds , and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to take a commanding 30 lead in the series Thursday in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 76er ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . As they 've been prone to do on occasion this season , the Sixers give a considerably superior team trouble late into the game . The performance was even more surprising considering that it came on the road , and on a night where var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] sported a depleted roster that was devoid of two of their most talented players . With var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] ( knee ) and var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( shin ) sitting out , it was up to the likes of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] to step up if var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was going to keep the game competitive . Both players answered the bell , tallying 26 and 25 points , respectively , which helped the Sixers impressively battle back from a 40 - 29 deficit after one quarter . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] even turned the tables on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the turnover department , doubling them up by eliciting var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] miscues from them while only committing var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] themselves , less than half of their per - night average this season . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and a steal to his team - leading point tally . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] supplemented his scoring with var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][DREB] assists , a pair of steals and a block . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] drew the start at shooting guard , and contributed a solid var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][STL] assists , var_player[0][0][FTA] steals and a block . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , garnering some extra minutes off the bench with all of the injuries in the frontcourt , paced the reserves with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][FTA] assists , a steal and a block . The Sixers remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division , and have the worst record in the league . They head down to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for the second game of the home - and - home series against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Sunday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] likely planned to give a much more abbreviated allotment of minutes to their front - line players going in , but all five members of the first unit ended up playing sufficient time to tally double - digit scoring . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the field with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][TO] assists , var_player[1][3][STL] steals and a block . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench and was also the second - highest scorer on the team , tallying var_player[1][5][REB] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][5][PF] assists and var_player[1][5][BLK] blocks over var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued his recent stretch of outstanding play with a var_player[1][4][PTS] - point , var_player[1][4][AST] - assist double - double that also included var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted a near double - double , registering var_player[1][1][PTS] points , hauling var_player[1][1][REB] boards and dishing out a pair of assists . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] rounded things out with a pair of var_player[1][0][PTS] - point efforts , with the former adding var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][2][DREB] steals , and the latter posting var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and a steal . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] remains atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and holds the fourth seed in the conference as well . They 're home on Sunday to face off in a return match with the Sixers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) pulled away in the second half to defeat the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Amway Center on Monday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has found success the past month largely due to the effort of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted a season - high var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting from the field while adding var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists over var_team[0][TEAM-REB] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent on the night and destroyed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the paint , but were also incredibly efficient from beyond the arc , shooting 7 - of - 17 . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got a brief scare in the third quarter when All-Star var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] went to the locker room after receiving a knee to the groin area . Fortunately he was able to return and finished with a team - high 20 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 5 FT ) to go along with eight rebounds . The minor injury caused a down night by var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's standards as he had posted at least 24 points and 12 rebounds in his previous three contests . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] did however get a big effort from var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored a season - high var_player[1][7][PTS] points on var_player[1][7][FGM] - of - var_player[1][7][FGA] shooting with var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][7][AST] assists over var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . Behind var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] were a slew of contributors , including var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who had another nice game shooting the ball Monday . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] has hit at least var_player[0][3][STL] var_player[0][3][FTA] - pointers in his past var_player[0][3][AST] games and is shooting 46 percent from downtown in his past five . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have now won six of their past eight games and are in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race with a matchup against the Nets set for Wednesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Pepsi Center on Monday . The wire - to - wire affair never saw one team pull away from the other , however , the control was mostly in favor of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) entered the game with an onslaught of injuries facing their lineup , including Dirk_Nowitzki ( achilles ) , Andrew_Bogut ( knee ) and J.J.Barea ( calf ) . All five var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) starters finished in double figures scoring , led by var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and his var_player[0][2][PTS] points . The impressive performance from var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's power forward also fell just one assist shy of a big triple - double , as he finished with 15 rebounds and nine assists on 13 - of - 17 shooting . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] saw var_player[0][8][MIN] minutes of action after dealing with soreness , but only contributed var_player[0][8][PTS] points on var_player[0][8][FGA] shots . The injuries have derailed the season for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who will struggle to compete with even the mid - level opponents . The road struggle continues for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] as well , who have just one road win on the year . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , to go along with rebound and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] also contributed an efficient effort with var_player[1][1][PTS] points on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting . Impressively , both teams shot above 50 percent as a unit , but the strong 53 percent effort from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was overshadowed by the even more powerful 57 percent effort from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Los_Angeles Clippers on Tuesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] visit the Portland Trail_Blazers on Wednesday .
It was an odd statistical night for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in every sense except the win column on Thursday . The top team in the Western Conference reached the free - throw line only eight times and hit just four of its attempts in the win . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] saw an unusual off night from beyond the arc , hitting only nine threes on var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent shooting . Reigning MVP and scoring champ Steph var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] had more rebounds than points , ending with a line of var_player[0][4][AST] points , var_player[0][4][FG3A] assists , and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] shot just var_player[0][4][TO] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] on the night . Fellow All-Star var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a strangely similar line , shooting var_player[0][1][BLK] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] for var_player[0][1][PTS] points to go along with var_player[0][1][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . Former MVP var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][0][FG3_PCT] points , a team - high var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , and yet another var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] finished with a ridiculous var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists on 45 shots , just the sixth game ever in which a team assisted on over 90 percent of its shots . For var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , it was a dismal offensive night , as only three players scored in double digits and no starter scored more than 10 . Point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][4][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][9][STL] assists , while bench guard var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][9][PTS] points and var_player[1][9][FGM] steals . The team shot just 40 percent and made only five three - pointers on the night .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell to the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] Thursday at the ORACLE Arena , despite shooting an impressive var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . In the second game of a back - to - back , coach Gregg Popovich uncharacteristically opted to play his veterans , and it paid off in a big way . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had himself a double - double in the contest , with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds ; he added var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][FTM] turnovers , while turning the ball over once . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] posted an equally impressive line of var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTA] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][PF] rebound , and var_player[1][4][PF] turnover in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes of action . var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] exploded Thursday for var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][DREB] - var_player[0][3][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) . His effort was n't enough , though , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] turned the ball over way too frequently , finishing with a total of var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] as a team . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with a season - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][BLK] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][FTM] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][STL] - var_player[0][4][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][PF] - var_player[0][4][PF] FT ) . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] did not score in the second half . The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] attempted an astounding var_team[0][TEAM-AST] more shots from the field than the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in this matchup.The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will play next at home against the Brooklyn Nets Thursday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Los_Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) narrowly defeated the struggling var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Thursday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] unexpectedly provided a team - high var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , helping lead the balanced offensive effort the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Superstar var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][3][PTS] points , below his average , but also pulled down var_player[1][3][FG3A] rebounds and dished out var_player[1][3][AST] assists . Big man var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , was not particularly present in the scoring column ( var_player[1][2][OREB] points ) , but made his presence felt on the boards , tallying var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds on the night . Overall , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had a strong offensive showing , racking up points and hitting 15 three - pointers on the night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has seen a steady plummet towards the bottom of the Western Conference following an injury to star point guard Eric_Bledsoe . The team 's loss on Thursday was their 21st in 23 games . Despite holding major advantages at the line and on the boards , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggled offensively , recording var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers and shooting just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . Even in the loss , however , rookie standout var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] made himself known with var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will host the Portland Trail_Blazers on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] next sees the court on Saturday as well , as the team will face off against the Utah Jazz .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at The Palace of Auburn Hills , Saturday . This was the second game of a back - to - back for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] but that has not been a problem for them at all , as they have now won their last var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] games on the second night of a back - to - back . This was an important win for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] as they remain in competition for the eighth spot in the East . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] put up a good fight but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were more determined down the stretch as they scored var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points in the final quarter to seal the deal and improve their home record to an impressive 21 - 12 . Seven players scored in double digits for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as the bench chipped in 52 points to help get over the hump on the second night of a back - to - back . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] finished with a team - high var_player[0][7][PTS] points ( var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][FTM] - var_player[0][7][FTM] FT ) , along with var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][7][BLK] assist and var_player[0][7][BLK] blocked shot , in only 18 minutes off the bench . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] tied a career - high with var_player[0][3][AST] assists , to go along with var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][FGA] assists and var_player[0][5][STL] steals , in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] totaled var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists on 46 made field goals , while giving up only eight turnovers . Despite shooting var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] could not find the momentum to get passed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have now lost five in a row on the road and 14 of 17 overall . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , with var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FTA] assists , var_player[1][1][FTA] blocked shots and var_player[1][1][OREB] steal , in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] minutes .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday . In the midst of a five - game losing streak and with their grip on a Western Conference seed growing increasingly tenuous , var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head coach Rick Carlisle decided to call an audible with his starting five against one of the hottest teams in the league . In to the first unit stepped var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , sending var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] to the bench for the night . The rather unusual move worked , as var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] hauled in var_player[1][4][AST] rebounds in addition to contributing var_player[1][4][PTS] points , helping to lead var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to a much - needed victory that snapped the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' seven - game winning streak . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played stingy defense against a var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] team that had been essentially hitting on all cylinders , holding them to a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field , and a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] percent figure from three - point range . They also elicited var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers on the night from the home squad , and hung on for the win despite a furious var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] comeback in the third quarter . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists , var_player[1][1][STL] steals and a block . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was right behind him with a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' vulernable frontcourt . He also added an assist and two blocks . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists , a steal and a block . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with a pair of var_player[1][6][PTS] - point efforts .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division , and have a hold of the seventh seed in the conference as well . They head to Cleveland to face off against the Cavaliers on Wednesday night .

All the talk around this game will be around var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and rightfully so . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 30,0 points , as he did it with a patented var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] fade away . That feat came in a relatively easy win too , as it was a wire - to - wire victory for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , with them leading by double - digits for the final 35 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] actually took a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point lead into the fourth quarter , but the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starters used that garbage time to cut it to a respectable scoreline . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was lights out from the field , as they shot 52 percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also thrived off turnovers , winning the points off turnover differential , 29 - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have been one of the worst teams in the league over recent months and this loss was much worse than it looks in the box score . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a bright spot , as he accumulated var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists en route to a triple - double . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the starters with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench , as he provided var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][PF] assists .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ended up taking the win var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - 93 . While the score was relatively close , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] held the upper hand through the majority of the contest . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] continued their early season struggles and fell to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] .

Four of those games have been without var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] , who has been sidelined with a knee injury since Nov. 16 .

He helped out with 13 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3PT , 1 - 1 FT ) eight rebounds , three assists , and one steal in 31 minutes of action . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] hopes to get var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] back as they carry their momentum into Friday 's game versus Atlanta .

The only player to touch the court and not score was veteran var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] , who did help out with var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][8][PF] assists , and three steals . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to win their first game following the firing of former head coach Kevin McHale last week , but have lost three games since . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did his part to help the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] take off , but was unable to do enough .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have shown perhaps a bit more than was expected of them , even factoring in an injury to key offseason acquisition Jeremy_Lin . However , most of their successes have come at home , as they entered Saturday with a 1 - 8 road record . Their futility away from Barclays Center unsurprisingly continued against the stingy var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , who elicited 16 turnovers from the visitors and held them to var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] percent and var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] also cut right through the heart of the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] defense , going for var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds , var_player[0][0][AST] assists , a steal and a block . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][0][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[1][0][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3M] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][AST] boards , var_player[1][2][AST] assists and a block . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][4][FGA] points , var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists , but var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] could only muster a combined 11 points . var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with a var_player[1][10][PTS] - point contribution , while var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[1][7][PTS] points in a reserve role as well . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was second on the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and a block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] contributed a pair of var_player[0][4][PTS] - point efforts , with the former also supplying var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists and a block , and the latter compiling var_player[0][4][AST] assists , a rebound and a steal . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[0][6][MIN] points over var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] was right behind him with var_player[0][9][PTS] points .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) managed to keep pace with the East-leading var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) for a majority of Tuesday 's contest , and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game . That was until var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] hit a step back var_player[1][0][PF] - pointer with var_player[1][0][FG3M] minutes remaining to take his team 's lead from var_player[1][0][PF] points to var_player[1][0][FTA] . At that point , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was finished . var_player[1][5][FIRST_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on an efficient var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting from the field to go along with var_player[1][0][FGA] assists and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last var_player[1][0][DREB] games . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points of his own , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted a double - double of var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][FGM] rebounds as Kevin_Love 's replacement and the newest Cavalier , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , came off the bench to score var_player[1][6][PTS] points Tuesday . As for those var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , a brilliant performance from var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season . After scoring 20 points in the third quarter , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished the game with var_player[0][0][MIN] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting from the field . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had yet another productive night as well , scoring var_player[0][2][PTS] points and grabbing var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , but besides those var_player[0][2][OREB] , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] failed to get much else offensively from their team . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] did manage to dish out a game - high var_player[0][4][AST] assists and grab var_player[0][4][FGA] rebounds , but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column , ending with just var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][STL] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting from the field . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets .

The win extends var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's streak to three games , but they did suffer a setback after var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] left the game twice with back soreness . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] returned to the floor after halftime , but his back flared up again and he 'll now be questionable heading into Wednesday 's contest against the Jazz . While the injury did not help the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , it also had little impact on the outcome . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had the hot hand in the first quarter , as they both powered their team to an early 18 - point lead with 6:30 remaining in the first quarter . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] aided the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in cutting that lead to nine points by the end of the first quarter , but var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] got back into their groove after pulling away by another var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - point margin halfway through the second quarter .

Before exiting , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] was a perfect var_player[0][1][REB] - of - var_player[0][1][FGM] from the field with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][PF] board and var_player[0][0][DREB] assist , while var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with a combined 25 points and nine rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) simply could not get enough offense moving to match the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] pace , and have yet to pick up a win on the road . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , while C.J . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] had a standout performance off the bench with var_player[1][5][PTS] points in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . Both teams play at home on Wednesday , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] host the Philadelphia 76ers , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] welcome the Utah Jazz .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) blew out the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] outplayed var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and led his team to victory with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][STL] steals in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes .

With the game in hand , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to deploy their bench players into the game early , every var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] player played at least var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] minutes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] took a break from putting up Oscar Robertson numbers for an evening . For just the third time this month he failed to record double - digit assists or rebounds , and for just the second time in March he did n't record 24 points or more . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a nice game in a losing effort . He matched var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] points to go along with 10 rebounds in 22 minutes . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] assists , var_player[1][6][FGM] steals and var_player[1][6][TO] block in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . His playing time had increased as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have dealt with injuries to pivotal players such as Kevin_Durant and Serge_Ibaka . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] still holds the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will try and regroup before they play the Jazz on Saturday , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Mavericks on Friday .

Coming close to playing themselves completely out of the playoffs after losing 10 games in a row , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] gave themselves some hope Tuesday , as they came out with a 10 - point win over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The win brings them within six and half games of the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference , but they will still need to keep on winning with just 15 games left in the season . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , on the other hand , continue to sit as the second seed in the West , seven games behind the Golden_State Warriors , but just one and a half games ahead of the Portland Trail_Blazers . They 've lost five of their last ten games now , but they will still likely finish in the top half of the standings if they do n't go on some extended losing streak in the near future . A big part of the win should be attributed to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' defense , as they forced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] into var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] turnovers , while committing just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] of their own . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way on the offensive side of the ball though , scoring var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][DREB] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) , while also handing out a ridiculous season - high of var_player[0][4][AST] assists . It was only his third game posting double - digit assists this season , while this arguably marked his best game since joining the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] at the trade deadline . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] notched a double - double of his own , finishing with var_player[0][2][REB] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocked shots . He had suffered a concussion during Saturday 's game , but cleared the concussion protocol prior to this matchup and played as if there were no lingering problems . With Greg_Monroe sitting out due to a knee injury , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] moved into the starting lineup . He took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 4 - 9 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and seven rebounds . After failing to reach double - digit points in nine straight games , he 's now gone two straight with 14 points or more . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a solid shooting effort as well and added var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . With Mike_Conley sidelined due to an ankle injury , it was the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt that had the most production , despite still suffering the loss . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] posted a double - double with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FG3M] - var_player[1][2][FG3M] 3Pt , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds and var_player[1][2][PF] assists . He had scored less than his season average of 18 points per game in each of his last three outings , so it was good to see the center get back on track Tuesday . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was locked in with his shot , going var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][0][FG3A] - for - var_player[1][0][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[1][0][PTS] points . He 's now pushed his season averages to 15 points and 4 rebounds on the year . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] were the only other players in double figures for points . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][1][FGA] points ( var_player[1][8][FG3A] - var_player[1][1][PTS] FG , var_player[1][8][AST] - var_player[1][1][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][8][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][8][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][DREB] - var_player[1][8][FGA] FG , var_player[1][8][PF] - var_player[1][8][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][8][FTA] - var_player[1][8][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][8][DREB] rebounds off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Friday .

The biggest surprise during this game was the strong bench play for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , which has n't been a strength for the majority of this season . In a postgame interview , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] heaped praise on var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] came off the bench for var_player[1][7][PTS] points , as he shot nearly perfect from the field , going var_player[1][7][FGM] - for - var_player[1][7][FGA] from the floor over var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] also played well off the bench though , scoring var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][5][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][5][FTA] - var_player[1][5][FTA] FT ) in 28 minutes .

Four other var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] scored double digits , with forward var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] coming up as the next - highest with var_player[1][0][PTS] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , in Game var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] of the Western Conference first - round playoffs Sunday at Staples Center . The opening games to the opening round of the 2016 NBA Playoffs closed with another rout , this time it belonged to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Heading into the series , some analysts pegged the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] series to be the toughest of the first round in terms of the Western Conference , but var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] played fantastic basketball and handled var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's group with relative ease in Game var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] built upon a five point first quarter lead incrementally through the remainder of the game . The second half proved to be on the side of interminable length after Terry Stotts elected to foul var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , and although the big man finished var_player[0][2][FTM] - of - var_player[0][2][FTA] from the charity stripe , the strategy failed after the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shooters could not get a clean look at the basket . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was swarmed by var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , and even when they broke through the double team , they were unable to finish at the rim . var_player[0][10][FIRST_NAME] finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FTM] rebounds and var_player[0][10][MIN] assists on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting , while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] played the best game since returning from injury and contributed var_player[0][4][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] had a block party while he patrolled the paint and added var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][3][FIRST_NAME] Reddick played more inside the arc , but the strategy paid off , as he shot var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the floor on only var_player[0][3][REB] attempts from the three - point line on his way to var_player[0][3][PTS] points in the contest . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot 53 percent from the floor as a unit and outrebounded the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] in the win . The prevention of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] from heating up , in combination with C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] 's inefficient shooting , put the game out of reach for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] early in the second half . It seemed as though every pull up shot was contested and there was no easy way to get a bucket for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , while var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] could only pitch in var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FGA] shots . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] showcased his athleticism , but even the acrobatic forward could found it tough to finish at the rim , as he added var_player[1][6][PTS] points on var_player[1][6][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][FGA] shooting in just under var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes off the bench . Game 2 is scheduled for 7:30 PM Eastern Time on Wednesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] Tuesday at AirCanada Centre . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came into Tuesday 's matchup without Pau_Gasol ( finger ) , var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( hand ) and Tony_Parker ( foot ) , but it did n't matter . Even without three regular starters , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to hold off a struggling var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) team , who remains without their All-Star shooting guard DeMar_DeRozan ( ankle ) . In the absence of three stars , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up with a solid performance , recording a team - high var_player[1][1][PTS] points on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting from the field to go along with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] then added var_player[1][5][PTS] points in var_player[1][5][MIN] critical minutes off the bench . Overall , it was n't the prettiest performance from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as they shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from behind the arc , but they still managed to notch their fifth straight victory . As for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , they continue to struggle , as they have now lost four games in a row after winning four in a row just before that . They had a prime opportunity to end that streak against a banged up var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] team , but while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] backcourt managed to take advantage , the frontcourt players struggled to do so . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][TO] rebounds , while Terrance var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][7][PTS] and var_player[0][3][PTS] points , respectively . The team 's start frontcourt , however , made up of var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] combined to score a grand total of just 11 points . Ball disruption was the ultimate problem , however , as the team managed just 10 assists to their 10 turnovers . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will try to make it six straight wins Friday in New_Orleans , while the the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to end their losing streak when they take on the Grizzlies on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has won var_player[0][1][PF] straight games , taking Monday 's win on the back of var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's double - double of var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also recorded a double - double of var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . Starting center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] suffered a broken hand in the game and is expected to be sidelined for a considerable amount of time . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost three of their last five , and surprisingly , the team continues to rest several of their key players despite losing games . var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] all sat out for rest , while Tony_Parker missed the game with his lingering hamstring injury . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored a team - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points , and six total players finished in double figures for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , perhaps surprisingly , shot well from beyond the arc Saturday , hitting 9 of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] in their rout of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] who have been known to shoot the three , were out - done as they went 7/18 from distance . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also took care of business from the free throw line , hitting 19 of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] only managed to earn nine free throw attempts . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] dominated the glass and were plus - 14 in rebounds , including 13 offensive rebounds . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was held scoreless in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes , but dished var_player[1][4][AST] assists .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , the league 's worst defense since the All-Star break , defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . DeMarcus_Cousins warmed up prior to the game , but ultimately decided not to play for the second straight game with an ailing calf . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] nearly accounted for a third of the team 's points , scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] to go with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists , var_player[0][1][FG3M] steals and var_player[0][1][STL] three - pointers in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] replaced var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] in the starting lineup , compiling var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][0][FTM] var_player[0][0][FTA] - pointer in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] grabbed var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds in var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] minutes , helping the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] end a var_player[0][7][TO] - game losing streak . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] threw down a monster dunk on var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , scoring var_player[1][7][MIN] points in var_player[0][5][FG3_PCT] minutes off the bench . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell half a game behind the Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers for the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoff push , losing their third straight game . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was inserted into the starting lineup after coming off the bench the previous var_player[1][4][STL] games . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and the man he replaced , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , were each assessed a technical foul . Even worse , var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] missed his first 11 shots and finished var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][FGA] from the field for var_player[1][6][PTS] points . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points and accumulated var_player[1][4][STL] steals in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] blocked a shot for the seventh straight game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] play their fourth straight home game when they face the Washington Wizards on Sunday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] begin a stretch of five games in seven nights Sunday when they take on the Minnesota Timberwolves .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at Staples Center on Sunday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) picked up a third win in a row and are heating up at the right time , given the Nuggets loss earlier Sunday , they are now tied for the eighth seed in the Western Conference . In addition , they host the Nuggets on Tuesday in an important game in the battle for the final playoff spot out West . Depth made the difference for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as their bench ran seven players deep , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) totaled nine players in rotation . Brandon_Ingram ( knee ) was sidelined in the contest . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] were not spectacular , but did enough on the offensive end to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ahead , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_player[1][3][FG_PCT] percent shooting effort was far from enough to match that of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steals and var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][FGA] points on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][PTS] shooting . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] totaled 28 minutes off the bench and pitched in var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][6][FGA] boards , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] fell var_player[1][6][BLK] points shy of a double - double and went for var_player[1][6][PTS] points and var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds across var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][3][PTS] points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] did not find a rhythm at any point and finished with just var_player[0][4][PTS] points on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting , while var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][AST] assists and var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds . Next up , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] host the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] play the same night and host the Washington Wizards .
On opening night for both teams , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held off the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in overtime . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] got off to a hot start , shooting nearly 53 percent from the field en route to a 57 - 46 halftime advantage . A var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] Knight-led run early in the third quarter pushed the lead up to 24 points , but the new - look var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] would fight back . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] outscored var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - 15 in the final period , slowly chipping away at the lead by stifling the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' ballhandlers on the defensive end . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] committed some key turnovers down the stretch , setting the stage for var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's heroics . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , who signed a var_player[0][4][DREB] - year , $ 48 million extension Tuesday , converted a layup to bring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] within var_player[0][4][OREB] points with seven seconds to play . Then , after var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] made var_player[0][4][PF] - of - var_player[0][4][OREB] free throws , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] came off a high screen and drilled a running var_player[0][4][FG3M] - pointer with less than var_player[1][0][FG3A] seconds remaining to send the game into overtime . A pair of var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] free throws gave the bucks the early overtime lead , but with the game tied at 106 with 16 seconds left , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] again looked to var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] . He sized up var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] at the top of the key and connected on a tough , step - back jumper to give var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - 106 advantage with var_player[1][4][FGM] seconds remaining . Following a timeout , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to get var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] an open look , but he misfired from the left wing as time expired . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] FG , var_player[1][4][FTA] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) to go with var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . O.J . var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][7][PTS] points off the bench , and var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] chipped in var_player[1][1][PTS] to go with var_player[1][1][DREB] boards . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . It was a tough var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] debut for var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with just var_player[0][3][PTS] points on var_player[0][3][OREB] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting . However , he added eight assists and a team - high 13 boards . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][2][PTS] to go with var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds .

The final scoreline indicates a somewhat lopsided game , but this was much closer than it looks . It was actually a tied ball game early in the fourth quarter , before var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] went on a var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - 6 run to open things up . What the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did especially well was limit mistakes , as they committed just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers and allowed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to record just three combined blocks and steals . Despite var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shooting a better percentage from three , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lived there , going 18 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] from long distance in their win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have now lost five - straight , as the All-Star break could n't come at a better time . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , as he dropped var_player[1][3][PTS] points to go along with var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] really struggled , as he went just var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field to accrue var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3M] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was their best player , collecting var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][FGM] rebounds on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was a nice spark off the bench , providing var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have now won nine of their last 11 games , as they continue to surge headed into the All-Star break . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the catalyst once again , as he accumulated var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][FG3M] assists on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was equally as good , tallying var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][FGM] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to provide var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][6][STL] assists and var_player[0][6][PF] steals on var_player[0][6][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][6][FGM] from three - point range . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday . The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] win , but var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] made a huge comeback for a much needed victory . In fact , they trailed by 20 headed into the half and proceeded to outscore the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , 70 - 46 , over the final two quarters . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] actually led for over 42 minutes of this game , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's only leads were in the first six minutes and final four minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] offense was extremely efficient , as they shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and assisted on var_team[1][TEAM-AST] of their var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] made baskets . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has really been struggling lately , but a comeback win like this could be the spark they need going forward . var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] Schroeder was the catalyst of the comeback , as he dropped a career - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points in the win . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was also huge , accumulating var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][OREB] blocks . var_player[1][3][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] Jr. got a rare start and accrued var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists in the win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will be off until Tuesday , when they host the Orlando Magic for their next game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has been playing some great ball recently , but heartbreaking losses like this are par for the course for such a young team . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] has carried this team on his shoulders all season long , but he totaled just var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][BLK] assist , dealing with foul trouble throughout the game . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] continued his great form though , tallying var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][FG3M] steals in the defeat . The other three starters combined for just 20 points , as the bench did everything they could to hold onto this game . In fact , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][5][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 49 points , 18 rebounds and var_player[0][6][FGA] assists on var_player[0][7][MIN] - of - 35 shooting as the only var_player[0][6][DREB] bench players to appear .

A combined 47 points from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] made up for the absence of var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( back ) , and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] posted respective success rate of var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and 44 percent from three - point range .

This team has simply been bad this year and it 's hard to figure why they play so well against the best team in the NBA . They 'll look to build off this performance against the Phoenix Suns on Sunday in their next scheduled game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] just ca n't figure out this var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] team and it 's just var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] of those phenomenons that 's hard to understand .

But a big run from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in the final period , which included some great back - and - forth between var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] in the closing moments , ultimately forced the game into overtime . From there , it was all var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] as var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] carried them through the final five minutes . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] hit var_player[0][3][FG3M] three - pointers en route to scoring a game - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points and grabbing var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also got yet another great performance off the bench from var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][5][PTS] points on var_player[0][5][FGM] - of - var_player[0][5][FGA] shooting from the field in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes as a reserve . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did everything he could for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the closing moments , matching every punch var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] threw at him and his team .

While the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] looked as if they were in control following that third quarter , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] exploded in the fourth and pushed their way to a tough var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] victory on the road in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

After averaging var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists coming into this outing , it was quite uncharacteristic of var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] to only dish out the var_player[1][4][AST] dime . His five turnovers also matched a season - high . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] double - doubled with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTA] - var_player[1][2][PF] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds over var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes , which marked his second of the young season .

Offensively , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] has been unstoppable to start this season , scoring 25 points or more in var_player[0][0][AST] of var_player[0][0][FG3A] games . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , nearly recorded the unconventional triple - double with var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][TO] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][PF] FT ) , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , and var_player[0][4][TO] turnovers . The 16 assists were a season - high for the guard , although the eight turnovers were as well , so it was n't all good . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had a big day as well , pitching in var_player[0][5][PTS] of the bench 's 22 points .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starters by var_player[0][4][FTM] points and were led by a var_player[0][4][PTS] - point gem from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . Game 4 will be on Sunday , when the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] look to even up the series in their home building . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played hard , but simply built too deep of a hole to overcome in this game .

Sixers center var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had endured a rough last var_player[1][2][BLK] weeks , posting var_player[1][2][TO] lackluster performances before serving a var_player[1][2][PF] - game suspension earlier this month for off - the - court scuffles on Thanksgiving Eve . He then was relegated to the bench in his first game back Monday , and shot 3 - for - 14 from the field during an embarassing 119 - 68 beatdown at the hands of the Spurs . Thursday , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] came back with a vengeance , responding with a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double over var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes . Meanwhile , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] got into foul trouble and therefore was limited to just var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes , leading to his worst overall outing of the season . The eight - year veteran was held to single - digit scoring for the first time in the 2015 - 16 campaign , posting seven points , seven rebounds , an assist and a block during his limited time on the court . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] was actually the only starter for the visitors that was able to tally double - digit points , as the majority of support he received came from the bench in the form of T.J.McConnell and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] collected var_player[1][5][PTS] points and added a rebound , an assist and var_player[1][5][FG3M] steals , while var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] managed double - digit scoring for the third time in the last var_player[1][7][FTA] games ( var_player[1][7][PTS] points ) . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] could only pitch in a pair of var_player[1][1][PTS] - point efforts , while var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] struggled through a var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting night on the way to only var_player[1][1][STL] points . The var_player[1][4][OREB] other bright spot in the starting var_player[1][4][FGA] was var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who continued his comeback from January knee surgery by posting a season - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points , along with var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , a pair of assists and a steal over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . It was the third time in his var_player[1][4][FTM] games this season that var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has increased his time on the court , as he works his way back to a starter 's allotment of minutes . The Sixers dropped to 1 - 22 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division with the worst record in the league . They head home for a date with the Detroit Pistons on Friday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] used a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] fourth quarter to come back from a var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] - 70 deficit entering the period . With var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] spending large chunks of time on the bench , it was veteran big man var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , making his return from a four - game absence due to a hamstring injury , that posted a season - high and game - high var_player[0][7][PTS] points . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds and an assist over a highly productive var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was solid once again despite being without his customary frontcourt mate for a large part of the game , collecting his fourth consecutive double - double with var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with his second consecutive double - digit scoring game , amassing var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] rebounds , and var_player[0][3][AST] assists , along with another pair of his trademark three - pointers . Like fellow reserve var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] also made significant contributions off the bench , tallying var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][REB] assists , var_player[0][6][FTM] rebounds and a steal over an efficient and stat - sheet - stuffing var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a Saturday afternoon showdown against the Clippers .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) routed the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Saturday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have been on a tear of late , picking up 13 of their last 15 games . After a mediocre start , OKC has established themselves comfortably as the third - ranked team in the Western Conference , and have slowly been gaining on the second seed San_Antonio Spurs , who currently rank dead last in strength of schedule . 2014 MVP var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with a var_player[1][0][PTS] - point scoring performance . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] paired the impressive points total with var_player[1][0][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][0][BLK] blocked shots , contributing to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's impressive 15 total blocks . All-NBA point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] showcased his skill too , posting a well - rounded stat line of var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . The dynamic duo of var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has been elecrtic this season , as both players rank in the top var_player[1][4][FGM] in the league in scoring . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , meanwhile , got off to a blazing hot start this season but have slowed down recently . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is now just 7 - 9 in the month of December and have dropped three straight games . Star point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , however , has not wavered in the face of the losing streak . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] delivered a dominant var_player[0][4][PTS] points , which he coupled with var_player[0][4][STL] steals on the defensive end . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's effort was not enough , however , as the team was held to just 35 percent shooting from the field on the night . OKC will hope to continue playing winning basketball as they prepare to take on the Sacramento Kings on Monday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , on the other hand , will face a tough challenge as they take to the road against the 30 - 2 Golden_State Warriors on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the Philadelpia var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] could have easily been tempted to think a playoff spot was in the bag coming into Friday night , considering that all they needed to do was take care of business against an overmatched Sixers squad . However , as has been the case on several occasions this seasons , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] proved to be a tough out for a considerable portion of the game against a vastly superior opponent . The Sixers hung with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] well into the third quarter , and did get a boost with the return of var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( concussion ) to the starting var_player[0][1][DREB] . The hapless home squad also turned the tables on the visitors in the turnover department , eliciting var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and commiting only eight themselves . Ultimately , however , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's league - leading 13th triple - double and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's double - double were too much for the Sixers , and helped lead var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to victory . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and a block , although he did account for a quarter of the turnovers for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] was guilty of committing var_player[1][4][TO] miscues himself , but more than made up for it by supplying var_player[1][4][FGA] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][FTM] blocks and a steal . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] also tallied a double - double , which consisted of var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks and an assist . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds and a block , although he handed the ball over to the opposition a team - high var_player[1][7][TO] times . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remain in first place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and currently hold the third seed in the conference as well . They hit the road again for a date with the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night . The Sixers ' starters were led by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][0][PTS] points , which he complemented with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][DREB] assists and a pair of steals . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] pitched in with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FTM] rebounds , var_player[0][1][PF] assists and var_player[0][1][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] managed a near double - double with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] boards , var_player[0][2][TO] assists , a steal and var_player[0][2][TO] blocks . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] registered var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][FGM] steals . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves - - and the team as a whole - - with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][6][DREB] assists and var_player[0][6][DREB] steals over var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench . The Sixers remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division with the worst record in the NBA . They 're home again Sunday for a date with the Boston Celtics .
var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] overpowered the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defense in a rather easy road victory for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , a team that 's been far from strong on the road this season . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][STL] rebounds and var_player[1][0][PF] assist on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting , while var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][FTM] assists and var_player[1][2][PF] blocks . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] put up a strong bench performance in his var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes , as he posted var_player[1][5][PTS] points and var_player[1][5][REB] boards . All five var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters did finish in double figures in scoring , with three tying for the team lead of 14 points . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] each had var_player[0][1][PTS] points , while var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in var_player[0][0][FGA] points and var_player[0][2][REB] points , respectively . Newcomer var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] played var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench and scored var_player[0][6][PTS] points , to go with var_player[0][6][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][6][TO] assists .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came into Friday 's contest with one of the worst defensive frontcourts in the NBA , surrendering a league - worst average of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points and var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] rebounds to opposing centers . This troubling trend for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was on full display Friday , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] tallying var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds for his ninth double - double performance of the season . The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] center made a season - high 22 shot attempts , draining 12 of them for a solid 55 percentage from the field . Meanwhile , forward var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with his own var_player[0][0][PTS] - point double - double , and added var_player[0][0][REB] boards . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] completely dominated the contest down low , outscoring var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] by a resounding margin of 52 to 18 in the paint and outrebounding them var_team[0][TEAM-REB] to var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was led by a valiant effort from C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] , who drained var_player[1][3][FGM] of var_player[1][3][FGA] shots on his way to a game - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points . The third - year pro added six assists and a pair of rebounds . Backcourt mate var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was solid as well , although he slogged through an atypical var_player[1][4][PF] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting performance . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did tally var_player[1][4][PTS] points , but it was a total that was significantly supplemented by the var_player[1][4][FTM] free throw attempts that he successfully converted . var_player[1][0][FIRST_NAME] Aminiu had his most prolific scoring night in nearly var_player[1][0][FTM] weeks with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , an amount he reached with the help of a season - high var_player[1][0][REB] three - pointers . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bench with the only other double - digit scoring effort on the team , amassing var_player[1][7][PTS] points and adding var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds and an assist . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head to Miami to face the Heat on Sunday . In addition to var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's and var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] ' outstanding efforts , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also enjoyed the benefit of a stat - sheet - stuffing evening from point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . The second - year pro managed 19 points , six rebounds , three assists , a pair of steals and a block , while visiting the free throw line a season - high 17 times . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was also outstanding off the bench , pouring var_player[0][5][PTS] points and adding var_player[0][5][TO] assists , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][STL] steals and a block over a robust var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . The third - year pro was pressed into extended action after starting shooting guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] sustained a dislocated pinkie finger and thus was limited to only 22 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a date with the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been a different team at home this season and much of it is reliant on their defense . Not only are they 50 at Palace of Auburn Hills , they are allowing just 85 points a game at home this season . Three-point shooting killed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as they went just var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - of - 27 in the defeat . Without Andre_Drummond , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had his best game of the season , recording a season - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][FGM] rebounds . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] were very effective off the bench , combining for var_player[0][6][MIN] points , 13 rebounds and var_player[0][5][FGA] assists in the win . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] continues to struggle in a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] uniform , as he scored just var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting in the defeat . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did all he could to keep var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in the game , as he accumulated var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Spectrum Arena on Tuesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) checked in to Tuesday 's contest with an unsightly 1 - 8 road record , a sharp contrast to the 7 - 2 mark they 've compiled at the Palace at Auburn Hills . However , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] took matters into his own hands , ensuring that var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] would stop the bleeding away from home , at least for a night . He tallied a team - high 24 points and supplemented it with seven rebounds , two assists , two blocks and a steal . He was aided by a pair of var_player[1][3][PTS] - point efforts from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , which helped make up for a forgettable outing from var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who played just var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes and scored var_player[1][2][PTS] points on var_player[1][2][FTM] - of - var_player[1][2][REB] shooting . Overall , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] enjoyed one of their better shooting nights of the season , posting a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field , while also limiting the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to sub - var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent tallies from both the field and three - point range . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][REB] assists , a steal and a block to his scoring total . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] checked in with var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds and a steal in addition to his points . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and a steal , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the reserves with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds , an assist and a steal . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] found scoring to be at a premium throughout the night , with only three players across the entire roster managing double - digit points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] unsurprisingly led the way with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][STL] rebounds , var_player[0][4][STL] steals and a block . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was next with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds , a steal and a block . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] registered a modest var_player[0][2][PTS] points but did haul in var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] could only combine for var_player[0][3][DREB] points , although var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] also brought in var_player[0][3][FGA] boards and dished out var_player[0][3][FG3A] assists . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][5][FTA] assists and a block . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] continue on the road , as they face the Boston Celtics on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are off until Thursday , when they welcome the Dallas Mavericks to town .
var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] needed only var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] minutes to turn in his best outing of the season , as the point guard tore up the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] for var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] also added var_player[1][4][FTM] three - pointers , and finished a remarkable var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] has cooled off considerably from his var_player[1][2][PF] straight 30 - plus point games , but was still efficient in his var_player[1][2][PTS] points after going var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] from the field . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had no answer for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 16 - of - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] shooting from behind the three - point line . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] did have a solid outing in his starting role , as he finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting , to go with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][FG3M] steals and var_player[0][1][BLK] block . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] could not find a rhythm and scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points on var_player[0][3][FGA] shots , alongside var_player[0][3][OREB] assists and var_player[0][3][REB] boards .
If you told the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] that they 'd lose var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] to injury , have var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] shoot var_player[1][0][FG_PCT] percent and see var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] foul out , it likely would n't be a pretty result . Despite all that , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] overcame a double - digit deficit in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime , but still could n't quite prevail . The key to victory for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] was defense , as they held the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting and out - rebounded them , var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . Despite fouling out , var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][STL] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks in the loss . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was huge off the bench for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , totaling var_player[1][6][PTS] points and var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] rebounds . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] best player , accumulating var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was a monster down low , scoring var_player[0][2][PTS] points and snatching down a season - high var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . Both var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] struggled big time , as var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] and var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have always been rivals and this thriller added to the historic matchup . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the hero , as he hit var_player[0][0][FG3M] late free - throws with var_player[0][0][TO] seconds left to win the game . Rebounding was the decisive statistic , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] winning that differential , var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 31 . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . No other starter had more than 10 points . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][6][AST] assists off the bench . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] added a big game to his heroics , as he led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team with var_player[0][6][PTS] points and var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds off the bench . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] combined var_player[0][2][MIN] points and 17 rebounds as the starting frontcourt .

The rather unlikely duo of var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with matching var_player[1][0][PTS] - point efforts , with the former adding var_player[1][6][PF] assists and var_player[1][6][FG3M] rebound and the latter also supplying var_player[1][0][FGM] boards . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][STL] steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][AST] assists and var_player[1][2][DREB] block , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's scoring total and added var_player[1][5][AST] assists , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] steal in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FGM] assists , a rebound and a block , and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , the only other member besides var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] to take the court , tallied var_player[1][4][FG3M] points , var_player[1][3][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FG3A] assist . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points , var_player[0][0][FTA] boards , var_player[0][0][DREB] assists , var_player[0][0][STL] steals and var_player[0][0][TO] block . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] boards , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][OREB] steal . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned in a var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][AST] - assist double - double that also included var_player[0][4][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[0][9][FG3M] assists , var_player[0][9][PF] steals and var_player[0][9][TO] block in var_player[0][9][MIN] highly efficient minutes . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] was productive as a reserve as well with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][OREB] steal . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[0][1][DREB] - point , var_player[0][1][REB] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[0][1][STL] steals and var_player[0][1][TO] block . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] return home to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to do battle with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night as well .

A wild back - and - forth battle featured plenty of offensive fireworks , most coming from the ususal suspects on either squad . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's dynamic duo of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] put together a pair of var_player[1][3][PTS] - point - plus performances , while var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] bounced back from a pair of lackluster games to hit that number as well . The fourth member of the var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point club was a var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] power forward , but not the one most likely to achieve the mark . It was notably var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , and not var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , that accomplished the feat , in an outstanding var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . As has happened on multiple occasions this season , var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] was forced to exit the game early with an injury , suffering a left knee ailment that prevented him from taking the floor in the second half . Despite having held a lead as large as 20 points and not having to face var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] over the final var_player[1][6][FTM] quarters , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were forced to fight until the final whistle , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] mounted a furious comeback . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] 's clutch var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - foot var_player[1][3][DREB] - pointer with var_player[0][3][FTA] seconds remaining kept things interesting until the very end , and it was n't until var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] drained var_player[1][3][TO] subsequent free throws with var_player[0][3][TO] second remaining that var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to breathe easy . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] points paced the visitors , and he added var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and a block . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] followed closely behind with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was next among the starters with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was productive in a reserve role as well , posting a var_player[1][6][REB] - point , var_player[1][6][REB] - rebound double - double .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remain in second place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and are currently in the sixth seed in the conference as well .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] extended their win streak to six games through excellent ball movement and selfless basketball , which has become a staple to their improved season . It was the fifth time over the last six games that var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] eclipsed 30 assists in a game , as they passed their way to var_team[1][TEAM-AST] total dimes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] is making the strongest case to defend his MVP title and led all scorers with var_player[1][4][MIN] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][FTM] rebounds on var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][4][FG3M] more var_player[1][4][PF] - point shots to his NBA leading 162 treys . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] is currently second amongst all deep threats , but was not nearly as effective as his backcourt partner , and finished var_player[1][3][BLK] - of - var_player[1][3][FG3A] from behind the arc . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was effective late in the game , hooking up with var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] for some devastating backdoor cuts and added var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] is becoming accustomed to rounding out the box score , and although var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] did not capture his ninth triple - double of the season , he did finish with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][DREB] assists and var_player[1][1][TO] rebounds on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] was reserved to the bench and is being given slightly more minutes , as he eases his way back after missing 16 games with an ankle injury . The UNC product shot the ball much better in his 24 minutes , adding 10 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will welcome the Miami Heat ( 22 - 15 ) on Monday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] mounted a late comeback to pull the game within striking distance in the 4th quarter to pad the var_player[0][2][FGM] points loss , as var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] found his stroke from beyond the arc . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][2][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][2][FG3A] from var_player[0][2][STL] - point territory , but the var_player[0][2][TO] that fell came at clutch moments .

The return of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] first round draft pick provides some extra depth , especially on the defensive end , for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] moving forward . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will take a few days off before hosting the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 11 - 24 ) on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] put on another show and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't have an answer for him .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have an eye on the future as the season rolls to an end in just a couple weeks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Portland Trail_Blazers on Friday , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will play in Sacramento against the Kings .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] blew out the injury - riddled var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Tuesday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) remains the league 's top team thanks to the win . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have now won five straight and sit atop the Western Conference , though San_Antonio sits just one game back from the lead . On Tuesday , the sailing looked as smooth as ever for the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] `` superteam , `` as former MVPs Steph var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] combined to score 47 . All-Star forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , meanwhile , had var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] assists , as well as var_player[0][1][STL] steals on the defensive end . All-Star var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] also had var_player[0][3][PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had won four straight before being blown out on Tuesday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] remains hampered by major injuries , as starters George_Hill and var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] were forced to sit out the game in Oakland . It was nothing short of an awful offensive performance for the depleted team , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot just 35 percent from the field and turned the ball over var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] times . Despite the team 's intense struggles , big man var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] continued to dominate , recording a game - high 16 rebounds and shooting var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] on the night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will host the Kings on Wednesday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will travel to Brooklyn to face the Nets on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) held off the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had a 16 - point lead going into the fourth quarter and it 's nearly impossible to beat this stingy defense with that sort of deficit . The rebounding was the big difference in the game , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] snatched var_team[0][TEAM-REB] boards compared to var_team[1][TEAM-REB] for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . These are teams going in opposite directions and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] proved tonight that good defense will always prevail . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this game as the worst defense in the NBA and the 101 points allowed is a significant improvement on those ugly numbers . It 's still not good enough to win and it does n't look that great when you notice that var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] currently has one of the three - worst offenses in the league . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] got a fantastic game out of var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] though , as he tallied var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][1][FG3A] steals in the loss . The more amazing part about that game is that it 's one night after being carried off the floor with a knee injury . What hurt the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on this night was the rest of the starters , as the var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] others combined for just 14 points , six rebounds , and five assists . That 's almost a nearly identical line to what var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] provided off the bench on Saturday as well , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] simply need more from their other starters . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will have to take on another potent defense when they play the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] played this game without Derrick_Favors and they did n't miss a beat . Favors missed the game for an unknown personal reason , but var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] filled - in spectacularly . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] amassed var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][BLK] assists , var_player[0][1][AST] blocks and var_player[0][1][PF] steals in the win . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was also fantastic off the bench , as he led the team with var_player[0][5][PTS] points and provided an additional var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][DREB] assists . This is a dominant defense , so when players like var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] can produce like this , they 'll be tough to beat . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will play the undefeated Golden_State Warriors on Monday in their next scheduled game and it should be a great test for this defense against the best offense in the NBA .
This win for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] completed the season sweep over var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have now traded off wins and losses across their last 15 games . The key for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] here was their shooting , as they hit var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their shots , while holding the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to under var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also took care of the defensive rebounding , winning that differential , 33 - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] carried var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he accrued var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][PF] steals . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other Pacer in double figures , as he tallied var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists on var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] amassed var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] both scored var_player[0][0][PTS] points , with var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] also providing var_player[0][2][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists .

In fact , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] pulled out a wire - to - wire victory , as they held a double - digit lead for the final var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - plus minutes . Defense was key , as they held var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting , while forcing var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . Much of that was attributed to the 11 steals and var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] blocks the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] recorded . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , tallying 20 points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] played just 27 minutes , but totaled var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in scoring , as he dropped var_player[0][2][PTS] points in an otherwise empty stat line . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's best player , accruing var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists .

The new - look var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are certainly playing up in pace under new coach Tyronn Lue , but an unintended consequence of their more prolific offense has been increased vulnerability on defense . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has been giving opposing teams extra possessions under their more aggressive style , resulting in some uncharacteristic shootouts in recent games that have them looking a bit like Warriors East . Such was the case Wednesday , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] managing one of their best scoring hauls of the season . Both teams shot well from the field and behind the arc , but the Cavs were just a tad more effective and also took better care of the ball . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was guilty of only seven turnovers on the night , as compared to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came into Wednesday 's contest with a plethora of injuries , missing the likes of Rudy_Gay ( Achilles ) , Omri_Casspi ( foot ) and Garrett_Temple ( hamstring ) . However , to make matters worse , var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] picked up his 15th and 16th technical fouls a game prior , which prompted a one - game suspension , thus ruling out the team 's best player . While the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were n't expected to even keep the game close , they fought through the adversity and picked up an impressive 16 - point win in front of their home crowd . Much of the credit can be given to var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who blew up for var_player[0][3][PTS] points , while shooting var_player[0][3][FGM] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][3][FG3A] from the three - point line . To go along with the aforementioned points , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] also added var_player[0][3][DREB] rebound , var_player[0][3][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][PF] steals . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's bench also came up big , outscoring the the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' reserves , var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] . That included var_player[0][7][FG3M] double - digit scoring efforts from the likes of var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][5][PTS] ) , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][7][PTS] ) and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][7][PTS] ) . As a team , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-REB] percent from beyond the arc , which easily bested the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent and var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] percent success rates , respectively . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did everything he could to keep the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[1][4][MIN] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) alive , posting var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][DREB] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTA] - var_player[1][4][FTM] FT ) , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists . He did n't shoot the ball at a high clip , but he got it done at the free throw line , as he connected on all 10 of his attempts . The only other var_player[1][1][FG3M] starters to reach double figures were var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted var_player[1][1][PTS] and var_player[1][2][PTS] points , respectively . Perhaps it was the uncertainty of the opposing team , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] just could n't keep up with the injury - depleted var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] team . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were once again without Avery_Bradley , who 's now expected to miss the team 's upcoming four - game road trip with a lingering Achilles injury . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will remain at home to play the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will remain on the road with a trip to Portland , where they 'll be taking on the Trail_Blazers .
With the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] surging and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggling , this result is far from surprising . The shooting was a glaring difference in this matchup , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot over var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hitting just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their shots . The fastbreak points was huge as well , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] doubling up the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , 32 - 16 . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] carried the load for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as he tallied var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals in the win . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded another double - double , totaling var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] boards . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] tried to keep the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hanging around , as he led the team with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][OREB] assists . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's most efficient player , as he accrued var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][PF] blocks . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined to shoot 14 - of - var_player[0][4][FG3_PCT] from the field in their defeat .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) dominated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] has thrived in his sixth man role , as Taj_Gibson missed his 10th straight game , and Wednesday was no different . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] scored a game - high var_player[0][7][PTS] points on var_player[0][7][FGM] - of - var_player[0][7][FGA] shooting and grabbed var_player[0][7][FTA] rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench . In his last var_player[0][7][AST] games , var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] has scored 52 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and is due for a minutes increase even when Gibson returns from injury . After four straight games scoring in single digits , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] put together a solid performance , scoring var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting , to along with var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] recorded yet another double - double , posting var_player[0][1][PTS] points on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] scored just var_player[0][2][PTS] points , but was active elsewhere , recording var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][FGM] assists . The win pushes var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to just a half game behind the Raptors for third place in the Eastern Conference standings and two and a half games behind the second - place Cavaliers . However , they still only hold a one - game lead over the Wizards for fourth place . Four starters scored in double figures for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the losing effort , but as a team , they could not get anything going , shooting poorly at var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , putting up just var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][DREB] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][PTS] ) , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][4][PTS] ) and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][FGA] ) round out the var_player[1][3][FGM] var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] starters in double figures , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] put up just var_player[1][5][FGA] points on var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][5][FGA] shooting in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . The loss moves var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] out of the current playoff race in the East , as the Celtics own the tie breaker over them . However , they still stand just one game behind the seventh - place Heat . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Raptors at home on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head to Cleveland on Friday to play the Cavaliers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came away with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] win against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) at United Center on Wednesday . With guards var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] struggling to find their shots , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] turned to var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted season highs in both points ( var_player[0][2][PTS] ) and rebounds ( var_player[0][3][PTS] ) while adding var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks over var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . The win helped the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improve to 7 - 1 at home this season and moved them into a tie with the Pacers for second place in the Eastern Conference standings . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] managed to take a var_player[0][2][FTA] - point lead into the fourth quarter after a var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_player[0][2][AST] run to end the third , but var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] was just too much in the final frame . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had an awful night shooting from the field , hitting 35 - of - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] and got absolutely no production from any guards , who combined to score 11 points . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had the worst night with just var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - 12 shooting , though he did dish out var_player[1][4][AST] assists . The lone bright spot for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who has been working his way back from an ankle injury . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][FTA] FT ) with eight rebounds and var_player[1][1][PF] assists over 28 minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came away with the win , but lost a key contributor in the process after var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was elbowed in the face in the first period and did not return . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] played just var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes before leaving , hitting a lone var_player[0][1][PTS] - pointer to go along with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and a steal . With var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] gone for the game , coach Fred Hoiberg turned to var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who has looked more like his old self lately . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] played a season - high 34 minutes , piling on var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds to go with his var_player[0][5][PTS] points and var_player[0][5][FTA] blocks . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] returns to action Saturday in the third game of a four - game homestand against the Hornets ; the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] play the fourth of a var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - game road trip Thursday against the Raptors .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( 29 - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - 19 ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has won four straight games . Six players scored in double digits for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Sunday , and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][1][PTS] ) , J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][PTS] ) and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) all scored over var_player[1][3][PTS] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has dropped two straight games , but they had won four straight prior to this road bump . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led the way Sunday with a game - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] lost the game on the boards , allowing the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to out - rebound them var_player[0][5][FG3_PCT] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] . This was third game the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have played against each other this season , with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] winning all three of the matchups . The final game in their season series will take place on Apr . 14 , the final day of the regular season , in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .
There was n't a whole lot to separate these two teams , as there were 19 lead changes and 14 ties in this Eastern Conference battle . No team led by more than eight points either , with neither team letting up at any point . Many of the statistics were very even , as they were nearly tied in rebounds , assists , turnovers and points in the paint . Despite var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] all shooting below var_player[1][0][FG3_PCT] percent , they all scored at least var_player[1][5][PTS] points in the win . The var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds for var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] marked his second double - double in a var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] uniform . Strangely enough , he 's yet to reach double - digit assists in any game this season , after leading the league in that category last year . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[0][2][REB] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds looks even more impressive when you consider the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are the second - best rebounding team in the NBA .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] announced earlier in the day that John_Wall would miss the game to rest a sore right knee , particularly relevant considering the must - win situation that var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] found itself in to keep their playoff hopes alive . As it turned out , they got by just fine without their All-Star against a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] squad that was undermanned in its own right . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] stepped in to the starting five and the offense never skipped a beat , as he managed an var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][FGA] - assist double - double that also included a trio of rebounds . Despite the victory , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] still depend on other teams for assistance to sneak into the playoffs , but must keep winning regardless to be able to take advantage of any help they might receive . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were paced by another stellar performance by var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was next among the starters , managing var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FG3M] rebounds and an assist . Although no other starter recorded double - digit scoring , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did fill out the stat sheet with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , eight rebounds and a block . The reserves enjoyed a productive night as well , with three players managing double - digit points . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , a rebound and an assist . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][9][FG3A] assists and a rebound , while var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with var_player[1][8][FGA] points , var_player[1][9][DREB] rebounds , an assist , var_player[1][8][FTA] steals and a block . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head to Charlotte to face the Hornets on Friday night . It was standout night for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] backcourt overall , as var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] paced all scorers with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , a steal and a block . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][REB] - rebound double - double that also included an assist and var_player[0][2][FTM] blocks . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , Jr. registered var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FTM] assists and var_player[0][0][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][6][FIRST_NAME] Hilario led the reserves with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][6][PF] assists , a steal and var_player[0][6][AST] blocks . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] made his presence felt off the bench as well , filling out the stat sheet with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][5][REB] assists and var_player[0][5][STL] steals . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , but remains 4 games behind the eighth - seeded Pistons , who also won Wednesday . They face off with the Pistons in Detroit on Friday night .
Before Tuesday night 's game against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] had been serving as an offensive liability for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Over his previous eight games , he had failed to score in double figures six times and was shooting just 23 percent from the field and 24 percent from behind the arc over the course of those eight games . Against var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , however , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] found a way to shoot himself completely out of that slump . The wing shot 4 - of - 9 from behind the arc and 7 - of - 15 from the field overall to put in 20 points Tuesday - - his highest scoring total since Jan. 15 . And while var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] is primarily known for his prowess on the defensive end , if he can consistently hit a high percentage of his jump shots like he did Tuesday night , it only makes the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] more dangerous .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-AST] - 25 ) routed the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) ,109 - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the Sleep Train Arena . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] simply outplayed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for much of the game and really started to pull away in the third . A seven point lead at halftime for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] suddenly ballooned to 20 by the end of the third quarter . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the only Wizard in double figures until midway through the third and finished with a team - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] built a large lead over var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] when they met last Saturday , but was intent on not letting the lead slip away this time as they evened the season series at one game apiece . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's four - game road trip got off to a promising start Wednesday with a hard fought victory over Utah , but has since sputtered out with two straight losses . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had a poor outing by his standards , going var_player[1][4][FGM] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field to end up with var_player[1][4][PTS] points in var_player[1][4][FG3_PCT] minutes of action . Kris_Humphries missed Sunday 's game and has not played since late February . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has an opportunity to salvage this road trip with a big game Monday against Golden_State . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] got its second straight win on Sunday with a terrific shooting performance . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] % from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] returned to action Sunday after missing two games with a calf injury . The star big man finished with 20 points , seven rebounds , five assists , and three steals in just 23 minutes on the floor . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong outing , scoring all var_player[0][3][PTS] of his points in the second half . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will return to action Tuesday when they host the 76ers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] welcomed var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] to the team with a victory . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was acquired by the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in a var_player[0][4][DREB] - player trade with the Boston Celtics on Thursday . He moved directly into the starting lineup , putting up six points , seven rebounds , nine assists and two steals in 34 minutes . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] capitalized on var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's passing to score a game - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have won three straight games and will try to extend their streak when they host the Atlanta Hawks on Monday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has lost four straight games during a stretch of their schedule that 's seen them face off against the Western Conference 's elite teams ( Trail_Blazers twice , Grizzlies and var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ) . Coming into Saturday 's game , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played two triple - overtime games in a row that saw some of their veteran players , like var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] , play over 40 minutes in each game . So , even without var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] ( hamstring ) and Kawhi_Leonard ( hand ) available to play , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] decided to rest var_player[1][8][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] , putting them behind the eight ball trying to win Saturday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will try to stop the bleeding when they host the Los_Angeles Clippers on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] finally got a game winning jumper to fall after a handful of failed attempts though January , and the var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] assisted baseline fadeaway with :23 remaining in the fourth quarter was enough for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_player[1][4][PTS] - var_player[1][0][PTS] ) to come away with a road victory . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) made var_player[0][2][TO] crucial error that put the game away for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] mishandled a pass resulting in a turnover following var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's go - ahead jumper . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was able to add on to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] lead with seconds remaining from the free throw line to put the game away for good . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a series on the defensive end of the floor where he blocked a var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] transition layup and then followed up by going coast - to - coast to put back a misfired shot from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Save for var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's costly error at the end of the game , the young var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] center went on to score var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] points and grab var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , to go along with var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers in the contest with var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points , dished out var_player[0][4][AST] assists and grabbed var_player[0][4][DREB] rebounds . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting , in addition to var_player[1][0][AST] assists and var_player[1][0][REB] boards . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] fouled out of the game late in the fourth quarter , which went along with the rough night of var_player[1][1][PTS] points on var_player[1][1][FGA] shots . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FTA] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds across a game high var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . Next up , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] visit the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] visit the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , in Game var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] of the Eastern Conference finals at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and company stayed unbeaten in the NBA Playoffs thus far , improving to 90 and storming out to a 22 - point halftime lead , which held up through the remainder of the game , to take Game var_player[0][0][BLK] on their home court . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were coming off their biggest win in franchise history , and the back - to - back seven game series looked like it took its toll on the team . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] were hounded by the Cavs guards and forwards throughout the whole game , and even when the backcourt duo got a clean look , they were unable to get into a rhythm , especially from behind the arc . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued to play his role as a scorer while the offense ran through var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] . J.R. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] was running up and down the length of the court with impressive play on both ends of the floor as well . var_player[1][5][FIRST_NAME] stuffed the stat sheet , and it only took var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes of action , as he finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][FGA] rebounds , var_player[0][4][FTA] assists , var_player[0][4][BLK] steals and var_player[1][5][OREB] block on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting , while var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] led all scorer with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[1][5][TO] boards and var_player[0][4][AST] dimes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] player to finish in double figures , as he added var_player[0][1][PTS] points , but var_player[0][7][FGA] bench players ( var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] ) all contributed var_player[0][8][PTS] - plus points . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] barely eclipsed the var_player[0][4][MIN] minute mark , which also led all var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] players , but the starters sat throughout the fourth quarter . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] seem to be the make or break factor for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to compete in the Playoffs , but only var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was able to get into a shooting rhythm , while the rest of the team looked abused with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] matchups . The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shooting guard scored 18 points on 9 - of - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] shooting , but var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] boards and var_player[1][4][AST] assists on var_player[1][4][TO] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting ( var_player[1][4][STL] - of - var_player[1][4][FG3A] from behind the arc ) . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were unable to find a scoring option off the bench either , save for var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , who muscled his way to var_player[1][5][PTS] points in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes of play . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is still awaiting Jonas_Valanciunas ( ankle ) return to the lineup , which might have to wait until Game 3 or 4 of the series , but his absence is proving vital to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] chances . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to even the series in Game 2 on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) handed the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) their 12th loss in 13 games Saturday , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was emphatic in its victory , outscoring var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] in the fourth quarter . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were a pinnacle of ball - movement in Saturday 's game , recording var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists on the night and hitting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their attempts from the field . Six var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] scored in double digits , with forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] leading the way with var_player[0][1][PTS] points . Backup point guard var_player[0][7][FIRST_NAME] Schroeder , meanwhile , exploded off the bench for var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][AST] assists , and var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds . The team also had a strong outing on the defensive end , stealing the ball 14 times in total . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's loss marks the continuation of the team 's slide towards the bottom of the NBA totem pole . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have lost 12 of their last 13 , and have also had to deal with the resignation of GM Billy King and the firing of coach Lionel Hollins .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot the ball more efficiently than the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and looked to rip off a strong run behind the highest scoring duo in var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , but the high power offense came up just short , as var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] drained back - to - back var_player[1][4][STL] - pointers late in the 4th quarter . While var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] was heating up , primarily on strong ball movement lead by var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] tried to pull away by double - digits in the 3rd and 4th quarters , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] simply hung around for long enough to turn the momentum in their favor . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] received almost the entirety of their offense from the starters , as the bench provided a lowly 16 points combined from var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[1][4][PF] rebounds and var_player[1][0][AST] assists , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists ( var_player[1][0][FGM] dimes in the first half ) and var_player[1][4][FTM] rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] hauled in a double - double , as he contributed var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] finished in double - figures to round out the starting var_player[1][2][FTM] . Billy Donovan did not rely on his bench and only var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] eclipsed 20 - plus minutes on a reserved role , as the starters all played 30 - plus minutes in the contest . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will continue their road trip when they visit the Minnesota Timberwolves ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) on Tuesday . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] did not back down from the difficult matchup against var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , and knocked down the game tying and go ahead var_player[1][4][STL] - pointers to earn the comeback win . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were battling uphill throughout the majority of the game and it came behind sub - 40 percent shooting through three quarters of play . The 4th quarter was an entirely different story , and when var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] gets a hot hand , he can be var_player[0][4][OREB] of the deadliest deep ball shooters in the league . The all star point guard finished with 31 points on 9 - of - 18 shooting ( 8 - of - 14 from 3 - point territory ) , to go along with seven rebounds and nine assists .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) took advantage of a major scoring drought at the hand of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) from the 9:0 mark to the 3:0 point of the first quarter , where var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was only able to salvage var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] basket during that period .

Once the blowout was too much for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , coach Gregg Popovich started to utilize the depth of his bench and rotated eight different players off the bench into the game . No one player on the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] played more than 28 minutes . Next up , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] host the Detroit Pistons on Monday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] get some time off before var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] host the Rockets on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] 's first season in a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] uniform has been anything but dull . The veteran has managed to overcome recent personal problems to serve as an integral part of the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] bench , as well as a terrific spot starter . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] filled in at small forward for Luol_Deng for a second consecutive contest and propelled the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to a road victory with a team - high , game - high , and season - high var_player[1][1][PTS] points . The particularly remarkable aspect of his performance was the fact that var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had only tallied only var_player[1][1][FTA] points by intermission . However , a second - half offensive barrage that included three of his four three - pointers on the night helped var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] significantly extend what had been a razor - thin 50 - 49 halftime lead , and cruise to an eventual 21 - point win . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's effort was complemented nicely by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who managed var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][FTM] rebounds , var_player[1][1][PF] assists and a block . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and a trio of assists . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had his worst shooting night of the season , going only var_player[1][2][TO] - for - var_player[1][2][FGA] from the field , making it his first single - digit scoring night in over two weeks and only the fourth game in which he has scored under 10 points . However , the standout center did haul in 14 boards , the third consecutive game in which he 's hit double - digit rebounds . Rookie Justice var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] received a robust var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench , and although he was n't terribly efficient with them , he did round out the stat sheet nicely . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's 2015 first - round pick finished with nine points , seven rebounds , an assist and a steal .

They remain home for a date with the Celtics on Monday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were thoroughly stymied by var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's suffocating defense , shooting only var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field for the game and barely seeing two of var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] starters crack double - digit scoring . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was var_player[0][0][BLK] of those players , but the superstar small forward could only muster var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , an assist and a steal over var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . It tied the veteran 's season - low scoring total , which he 'd posted in the opener versus Milwaukee . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] matched var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] 's var_player[0][0][PTS] points and added var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FTA] steals and var_player[0][0][REB] blocks . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] Calderon-the rest of the starting var_player[0][4][FGA] - - only totaled eight points between them . Reserve forward var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] player to reach double figures , tallying var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][REB] rebounds and an assist over a very efficient var_player[0][9][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a date with the Rockets on Sunday .
Statistics are a strange thing and they 're even more bizarre when looking at this box score . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] actually won the shooting percentage , rebounding battle , fastbreak points , points in the paint and assist - to - turnover ratio differentials , despite losing the game . No team led by more than 10 points , but there were only five ties and four lead changes . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] once again carried the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as he tallied var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , hitting numerous big shots late to cap the win . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] continued his MVP form for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , accumulating var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds and var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] assists in the defeat . Both benches struggled in this game , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] getting 28 bench points to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] . These two teams will have a rematch on December 12 in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] .
These are two teams that have been struggling mightily , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have been the better team this year and they showed why in this game . The assist - to - turnover ratio was the big difference , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] recorded var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] assists to just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] matched their assists to turnovers at var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] a piece . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the only var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] player with more than 10 points , as he tied a career - high with var_player[1][2][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] also added var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][AST] assists , var_player[1][2][BLK] steals and var_player[1][2][STL] blocks on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting to his impressive stat line . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] departed the game in the first three minutes due to a leg injury , but returned to lead the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] also dropped var_player[0][6][PTS] points , as he added var_player[0][6][FGM] rebounds off the bench . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded another double - double , totaling var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in the defeat .
As has become the usual for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , superstar center var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] `` Boogie `` var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] led the way in just about every area for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] posted team highs in points , rebounds , assists , and steals , with var_player[1][1][PTS] , 14 , var_player[1][1][AST] , and var_player[1][1][PF] respectively . The impressive numbers came on what was a relatively `` off `` night for the star , as he shot just 8 - of - 21 from the field and 5 - of - 8 from the free - throw line with six turnovers . Sixth man var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] was dominant off the bench , posting var_player[1][7][PTS] points and var_player[1][7][AST] assists in just var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's bench , meanwhile , did it no favors . While typical starter var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][5][PTS] , the remaining backups combined for only var_player[0][5][PTS] themselves . Two starters posted double - doubles , as center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][2][PTS] with var_player[0][4][FGA] rebounds , and point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] to go with var_player[0][4][AST] assists .
var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's 18 - foot basket with var_player[0][0][STL] second remaining proved to be the game - winning shot , as var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][FGA] - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer failed to find the net , clinching var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's hard - fought road win . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] compiled a game - high var_player[1][3][PTS] points , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a distant second with var_player[1][1][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][2][PTS] points , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][0][PTS] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , now presumably the starting point guard for the remainder of the campaign due to Kyle_Lowry 's wrist injury , contributed a modest var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][TO] steals over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][0][PTS] points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] were next with matching var_player[0][4][PTS] - points efforts . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] drew another start for Kristaps_Porzingis and registered var_player[0][1][PTS] points . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] boards and var_player[0][2][AST] assists .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] utilized a balanced offensive attack and a stingy defense to record their first road victory against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . All five members of the starting five reached double - digit scoring , led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] ' var_player[1][0][PTS] points . The remainder of the first unit , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , combined for another 55 points , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[1][3][PTS] - point , var_player[1][4][PTS] - rebound double - double off the bench . All of the strong offensive performances led to a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received double - digit scoring efforts from var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , but also saw var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] held scoreless over var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] was the only bench player to hit double digits in the scoring column , although forward var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] did manage to haul in var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got off to a fast start , led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , accumulating a lead as high as 24 points in the first half . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] promptly responded though , battling back to cut the deficit to nine , as the buzzer sounded signifying the end of the second quarter . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] tallied a line of var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][TO] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FTM] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][AST] assists , and var_player[1][0][PF] steals while turning the ball over var_player[1][0][FGM] times . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was held scoreless in the first half , but was a huge factor in the second half finishing with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][PTS] FG , var_player[0][3][BLK] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][OREB] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] looked to be on their way to closing this game out late in the fourth quarter after surrendering just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] through the first var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] minutes of the period . However , thanks to some clutch throw shooting and an offensive foul from var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to send this contest to overtime . Recently acquired var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] drained the go - ahead var_player[1][4][DREB] with just over a minute to go in the overtime period to give the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] a lead they would not relinquish . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] snapped its two - game losing skid in a tight game that went down to the wire . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_player[1][3][PTS] points and he added var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have a quick turnaround as they will travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Wednesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had a chance to win consecutive games for the first time since late November , but came up short . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were n't able to survive overtime without their best player , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] , who fouled out late in the fourth . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was also without var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] for most of the game after he suffered a sprained knee in the first quarter .

While var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did everything he could to bring the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] back in this game , he just did n't get enough help in the end , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took the loss . This was a tough defeat for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as it pushes them to a half - game back from the New_Orleans Pelicans for the final projected playoff spot in the var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] . The Pelicans play the Houston Rockets on Sunday as well , so they could extend their lead to a full game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , on the other hand , remain alive in the East with their fifth straight win . They 're now even with the Brooklyn Nets for the final playoff spot in the East , although the Nets hold the tie breaker over them , so they 'll likely need to win their last two games in order to pass up the Nets . It was C.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] who came up with the huge night on Sunday . He went 9 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 30 points , while also posting 10 rebounds . It was his second impressive performance in a row , as he 's combined for 54 points and 15 rebounds over his last two games .

The double - double was his third in a row , a stretch where he 's averaging 13 points and 11 rebounds per game . Including some clutch buckets during the final few minutes of the game , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][REB] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][AST] FT ) and var_player[0][4][FTA] assists over var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes . He shot just 2 - of - 6 from the field in Friday 's game against the Pistons , so the guard was able to get pointed back in the right direction Sunday . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did everything he could to try and pick up the win for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] took nearly half of the teams ' total shot attempts in this var_player[1][4][OREB] , recording a ridiculous var_player[1][4][FGA] field goal attempts , while converting on var_player[1][4][FGM] of them . He finished with a monster line of 54 points ( 21 - 43 FG , 5 - 15 3Pt , 7 - 11 FT ) , nine rebounds and eight assists over 40 minutes , but he just did n't get enough help from his teammates to convert those impressive numbers into a win . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has combined for 81 points over his last var_player[1][4][TO] games alone . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] were the only other var_player[1][3][REB] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] players to reach double figures in points . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][PTS] FG , var_player[1][3][DREB] - var_player[1][1][PF] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FT_PCT] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][PF] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][AST] - var_player[1][1][AST] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][OREB] FT ) , var_player[1][1][PF] rebounds and a block .

The loss further hurts var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's already slim playoff chances , as they currently sit six games behind the eighth - place Miami Heat . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will head to Denver Friday to take on the Nuggets , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Portland Friday to go up against the TrailBlazers .

The game was tight throughout , as neither team led by more than 11 points while the lead changed hands 25 times .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at the TD Garden in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Down var_player[1][4][FG3M] points with just over 10 seconds left in the game , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] brought the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] back to tie the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] after a driving layup . It was the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] who came out with the last laugh though , as var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] hit a clutch jump shot with just under a second left in regulation to pull out the victory . It was a solid victory for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they 're now going to go into the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference standings , meaning they 'll take on the Cleveland Cavaliers during the first round . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , on the other hand , moved down into the fourth seed in the East , a game behind the Chicago Bulls , which would mean they could end up playing the fiffth - seeded Washington Wizards in their first playoff matchup . It was the duo of var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] that had the biggest impact in securing the win Tuesday . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] nearly came out with a triple - double , finishing with var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][TO] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG ) , var_player[0][0][TO] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . It was n't all good for the forward though , as he did record seven turnovers as well . He 's combined for 29 points and var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] assists over his last two games , and he 'll need to continue to play well if the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] want any chance at pulling off an upset during the playoffs . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][BLK] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][TO] - var_player[0][3][DREB] FT ) of his own , to go along with var_player[0][3][TO] rebounds and var_player[0][3][PF] assists , but he ended up suffering a left quad contusion and was forced to leave the game . He 'll likely sit Wednesday 's finale out in order to get healthy for their first playoff matchup . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] were the other var_player[0][2][FTM] starters in double figures . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][OREB] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][STL] - var_player[0][1][AST] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][DREB] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . For the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] went var_player[1][4][REB] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][4][TO] - for - var_player[1][4][AST] from the three - point line to match a team - high of var_player[1][4][PTS] points , while also recording var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FTA] assists . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] has really struggled with his shot lately , combining to go just 9 - for - 34 from the field over his last var_player[1][4][TO] games , so he really needs to get things turned around if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] want to have some success in the playoffs . Despite struggling with his shot similar to var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , Louis var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] still posted var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][PF] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][4][FTA] 3Pt ) , as he was able to get to the free throw line var_player[1][5][FTA] times , while converting on var_player[1][5][FTM] - of - var_player[1][5][FTA] . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] continues to be a great offensive option off the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench , averaging 21 points over his last six games . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] nearly came up with a double - double , posting var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][PF] - var_player[1][2][REB] FG , var_player[1][2][BLK] - var_player[1][2][TO] FT ) , var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocked shots , while var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FTA] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FG3M] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FGA] assists .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) Tuesday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . With the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] now locked into the Western Conference 's third position , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] took the opportunity to rest var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and Serge_Ibaka . Their offense clearly suffered in their absence , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] committed more turnovers ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] ) than assists ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) and scored a meager var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points in the third quarter , which allowed var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to turn a 48 - 46 halftime deficit into a 71 - 57 lead heading into the fourth quarter , more than enough to stave off a final push from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][1][PTS] points on an efficient shooting night ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][TO] - var_player[0][1][TO] 3PT , var_player[0][1][FTA] - var_player[0][1][FTA] FT ) to lead the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][0][PTS] ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG ) and added var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] added his league - leading 62nd double - double with var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FG ) and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just 4 - 19 ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) from three - point land and var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent overall , but they pulled down var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] offensive rebounds to produce just enough offense to win . The scoring load for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell squarely on var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's shoulders , as he hoisted up var_player[1][4][FGA] shots and tied var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] 's game - high var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][AST] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3PT , var_player[0][1][DREB] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] FT ) . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] added a double - double with var_player[1][6][PTS] points and var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds ( var_player[1][6][OREB] offensive ) , but not a single other var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] player reached double figures . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and missed eight free throws ( 14 - 22 , var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent ) as they clearly missed var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] 's presence . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] next host the Mavericks on Friday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] return home to host the Clippers on Thursday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) beat the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in blowout fashion Tuesday by a score of var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . In a game that featured one of the league 's best offenses in the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] pitted against one of the league 's stingiest defenses in the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , offense prevailed as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] led by 20 points for the majority of the second half . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot lights - out , hitting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had six players score in double figures , led by var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] with var_player[0][3][PTS] points . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was coming off of a tight game Monday against the Rockets that came down to the final minute . That certainly did n't help their cause as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were out of contention for much of this game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is an even 1 - 1 on their Western Conference road trip but will get two days off before taking the floor again Friday against the Thunder . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has won three straight . They have the next two days off before starting a road trip that begins against the Boston Celtics on Friday .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] at Moda Center on Wednesday . Despite the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] pulling out a rare wire - to - wire win , this game was close throughout . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] trailed by one with just var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] seconds left , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] closed things out with some clutch free throws . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was lights - out with their jumpers , shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] carried the load , as they combined for 71 points , var_player[0][3][FGM] rebounds and 10 assists in the win . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) has gotten off to a rough start this season , but they continue to hang around in every game . After back - to - back career - high nights , var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] settled for var_player[1][3][PTS] points on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting in the defeat . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's best player , totaling var_player[1][4][MIN] points , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][DREB] assists , with 15 of those points coming in the fourth quarter . Four bench players scored in double figures , as var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] , P.J . var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 42 points . var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] was very important off the bench , accumulating var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][7][DREB] assists and var_player[1][7][OREB] steals . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] play again on Wednesday , when they host the Detroit Pistons for their next game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were expected to dominate this game , but it was closer than fans would hope . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] did everything they could though , as they each scored 30 - plus in dominating performances . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] was n't far behind , as he tallied var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][FTM] assists of his own . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was third on the team , with var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] boards . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] played just var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes before exiting with a calf injury in the first quarter . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to build off this win against the surging Los Angles Clippers on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 8 - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( 7 - 7 ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in Game 7 of their second - round playoff series on Sunday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and have won the series . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were in full control of the game from start to finish . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had their runs , closing the gap to as low as var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] points at one point in the third quarter , but they could never get over the hump and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] had little trouble sealing the deal , closing out the series and advancing to the Western Conference Finals . Following the Game 6 victory where he did n't play a single minute in the fourth quarter , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a masterful performance , scoring a game - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][DREB] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][TO] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) to go along with var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][STL] steals in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was an absolute sharp shooter from behind the var_player[0][0][AST] - point line Sunday afternoon , shooting var_player[0][0][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][0][FG3A] from behind the arc and scoring var_player[0][0][PTS] points along with var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds in var_player[0][0][FG_PCT] minutes . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted yet another double - double , totaling var_player[0][2][PTS] points ( var_player[0][2][FGM] - var_player[0][2][FTA] FG , var_player[0][2][FTM] - var_player[0][2][FGA] FT ) and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes ; this third straight double - double and seventh in his last var_player[0][2][FGA] games . Mid-season acquisitions var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][1][PTS] ) and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][7][PTS] ) round out the five Rocket players who scored in double figures . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' loss means the franchise still has yet to make a Western Conference Finals in their history , and the loss occurred at the hands of an epic collapse . Even though var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] is the undisputed leader of the team , he is not to fault for the loss , as he played his heart out in the losing effort . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt ) , var_player[1][4][PF] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , recording var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists in var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's effort caps off an incredible playoff run where he posted averages of 25 points , var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists over 40 minutes . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] posted a double - double of his own , putting up var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][2][REB] ) and J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][PTS] ) round out the var_player[1][5][PF] var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] players who scored in double figures . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] could have used more out of var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who after playing solidily throughout the entire playoffs , was held scoreless in var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] minutes of play . With the win , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] completed an incredible comeback after finding themselves down var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - 1 in the series and have now earned the right to play in the Western Conference Finals . They will go up against the Golden_State Warriors , who they played four times during the regular season and lost all four meetings .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . With just four games left in the season following this one , this was another huge win for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , who have now moved just a half game back from the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings . They had previously lost four in a row and seven of their last ten , so this was a huge sigh of relief for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Conversely , it was very tough loss for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , who also remain in reach of that final playoff spot . The loss brings them to two games back from the Celtics , so they 're officially in desperation mode for their final five outings . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] percent . They were led by point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored a team - high of var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][BLK] - var_player[0][4][STL] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTA] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . His shot looks to be dialed in at the moment , as he 's combined to shoot an impressive 16 - for - 26 from the field to score 43 points over his last two games . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] also played a big factor in the win . He posted 21 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and six rebounds , while playing 41 minutes . After recording just three points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field in Sunday 's game against the Pacers , he got back on track with this line , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will need him to continue to stay hot if they want to push themselves into the playoffs . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong showing as well with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][BLK] - var_player[0][3][STL] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . He did have a season - high of seven turnovers though , so it was n't all good for the guard . It was var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] that kept the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] close though . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][3][REB] from the three - point line to score a game - high of var_player[1][3][PTS] points before fouling out . It was his second highest points total of the season , as he was able to shoot higher than 60 percent from the floor . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had decent showing as well . In 39 minutes , he finished with 17 points ( 7 - 20 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , four assists and three steals . He 's now combined for 41 points and six assists over his last two games , but he 'll need to do even more if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] want any chance at sneaking into the playoffs . Recording a double - double , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][2][REB] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][BLK] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FT ) , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][FGM] blocked shots . Getting the start and extended playing time with both var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] and Cody_Zeller sidelined , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] was able to record var_player[1][2][TO] of his better statistical outings of the season . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][6][PTS] points ( var_player[1][6][FTA] - var_player[1][6][FGA] FG , var_player[1][6][BLK] - var_player[1][6][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][6][FTA] - var_player[1][6][FGM] FT ) and var_player[1][6][FG3A] assists off the bench . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday .
Things looked to finally be turning around for var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who got off to an incredibly rough start to the regular season . However , after four straight games where he shot over 50 percent from the field , he posted another clunker of a game on Wednesday night , shooting just 5 - of - 14 from the field en route to an underwhelming 15 points . Most striking , though , might have been his 3 - of - 11 performance from long range and his performances from behind the arc all season . Through his five - year NBA career , var_player[1][3][FIRST_NAME] has not made less than 40 percent of his var_player[1][3][FG3M] - point attempts . Through var_player[1][3][FG3A] games this season , var_player[1][3][FIRST_NAME] is shooting just var_player[1][3][MIN] percent from behind the arc , and while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are surviving despite the sharpshooter fighting inconsistencies and failing to live up to standards , they 'll want their shooting guard playing his best when it really matters .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Smoothie King Center on Wednesday . Despite there being just four ties and 11 lead changes in this game , it was close throughout . In fact , neither team led by more than 10 points , as it came down to the final seconds . Three-point shooting was the only real difference , as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] went just 9 - of - 29 , while var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] went 8 - of - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] . The statistics were unbelievably close , as rebounding , assists , steals , blocks and turnovers were all within two of one another . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) are 5 - 2 since the All-Star break , as they continue to patch things together without Kyle_Lowry . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the star , as he accrued var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds to lead var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] finished second on the team , collecting var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][AST] assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][FGM] rebounds , var_player[1][1][FG3M] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks . On deck for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is a road matchup with the Atlanta Hawks on Friday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][2][PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) are now just var_player[0][2][STL] - var_player[0][2][FTM] in games with var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , as they simply ca n't find any rhythm . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] did lead the team in scoring , though , tallying var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][FG3M] assists and var_player[0][2][OREB] blocks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] totaled just var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][FGA] rebounds , as he left after var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes with a wrist injury . var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] played well off the bench in his second game with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , as he provided var_player[0][9][PTS] points , var_player[0][9][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][9][AST] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will play the Charlotte Hornets for their next game on Saturday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dominated this game offensively right from the beginning , out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 65 - 39 by half , and reaching the 100 - point mark after just the third quarter . Their superior shooting was a big reason for this , as they went 49 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . Along with that , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also secured a var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - 38 rebounding advantage , only furthering their impressive performance Tuesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] saw six players reach double figures in this one , along with three reaching the 20 - point plateau . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the way , going var_player[1][0][FGM] - for - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][0][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][0][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a team - high of var_player[1][0][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists in just 26 minutes . He 's now shot 40 percent or higher in each of his last four games , a span where he 's averaging 23 points and 7 rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] also was a big factor in the win , finishing with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][REB] FG , var_player[1][2][FG3A] - var_player[1][2][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][2][FTA] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocked shots . Like var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] , he 's been a beast lately , averaging 24 points and 11 rebounds over his last var_player[1][0][FTA] games . Both players could have put up some even higher numbers in this matchup , but because of the blowout , they were each held to less than 30 minutes on the court . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was also very efficient with his time , scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][DREB] - var_player[1][4][AST] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) in just var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes .

Coming off the bench , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] reached double figures as well with var_player[1][5][PTS] and var_player[1][6][PTS] points respectively . As shown by their final score , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggled to get much going Tuesday , including having all five of their starters combine for just 24 points . With that being said , they did see some solid contributions off their bench . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , posting var_player[0][7][PTS] points ( var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][BLK] - var_player[0][7][FGM] 3Pt , var_player[0][7][REB] - var_player[0][7][FTA] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][7][TO] assists in 32 minutes . It was a season - high in minutes for the guard , as he took advantage of the extra time with his second 15 - point showing in a row . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was also var_player[0][5][FG3M] of those bench players who provided some points . He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points , while adding six assists and two steals as well . It was just the sixth time all season that he finished in double - digit points .

However , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] was healthy enough to take the floor after all , and posted his second - best scoring total of the season with var_player[1][0][PTS] points on a season best var_player[1][0][FG_PCT] percent shooting . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] 's return sent var_player[1][6][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] Peace back to the bench , where he failed to score over 17 minutes of action . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also received a team - best var_player[1][3][PTS] points from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , which served as the young guard 's best game since his season - high 30 - point outburst versus the Nuggets on Nov. var_player[1][3][STL] . Rookie var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] tallied only var_player[1][4][PTS] points over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes , marking the third time in var_player[1][4][FG3A] games that he 's failed to score in double digits .

They head home for a Sunday tilt versus the Pistons . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] benefited from an impressive double - double from offseason acquisition var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . It was another forgettable performance for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' frontcourt , who came into Friday night 's contest ranked last in scoring surrendered to opposing centers at an average of 25 points per game . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] supplemented var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] 's contributions with var_player[0][4][FGA] points , var_player[0][2][FGA] rebounds , and var_player[0][2][PF] steals , while var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in with another highly efficient performance off the bench . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] tallied var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][AST] assists , and a steal in just var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes , and was the only other var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] player with double - digit points .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at the Pepsi Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dominated this game , finishing with the scoring advantage in every single quarter of play . Their shooting percentage was a big reason for that , as they went 47 percent from the field , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also out - rebounded the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-REB] - var_team[0][TEAM-REB] , even furthering their advantage and helping them secure an impressive var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - point victory on the road . It was a total team - effort for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on Monday , as they had seven of their var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] players reach double figures in points . At point guard , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] did the most for the starters , finishing with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][BLK] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][FTM] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . After struggling for a long stretch of the season , it looks as if he may have figured things out during the All-Star break , as he 's posted two double - doubles in a row , a stretch where he 's combined for 28 points and 27 assists . Rookie var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] was in the starting lineup and had the best game of his career . He set career - highs in both points and rebounds , finishing with 10 and 11 respectively . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] also saw a huge effort from their bench , with both var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] doing their part . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][BLK] - var_player[1][5][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][5][FTM] - var_player[1][5][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][FG3M] - var_player[1][7][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[1][7][FTA] - var_player[1][7][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] has put in a couple of strong games in a row , combining for 41 points and 33 rebounds over the last two . While most of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggled to get anything going , it was var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] who got hot Monday . He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 22 points . It was his first game shooting over 50 percent from the field since the end of January , so we 'll see if he can keep it up moving forward . Coming off the bench , var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] had himself a game , recording var_player[0][8][PTS] points ( var_player[0][8][FGM] - var_player[0][8][FGA] FG , var_player[0][8][TO] - var_player[0][8][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][8][FTM] - var_player[0][8][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][8][FTM] rebounds in just var_player[0][8][MIN] minutes . In the two games since coming over from the Trail_Blazers , he 's now set a new season - high in points during both outings , as he 's getting a lot more run on the court with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] than he was with his previous team . With var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] sitting out , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] moved into the starting lineup and posted var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][PF] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . It was only his second start of the year , so it was good to see him have some success . Rookie var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other Nugget in double figures , as he finished with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][TO] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][BLK] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) of his own .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) notched a rare road win Wednesday at the Vivint Smart Home Arena , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] over the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] ) . Down three to open the fourth quarter , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] completely stifled the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] down the stretch and allowed only __ fourth quarter points to run away with the game in the final minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got hot from three - point land , as they knocked down var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] of their 21 attempts , led by var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PF] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] shooting effort from deep . var_player[0][0][FIRST_NAME] led var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starters with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , but the game 's high scorer was var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points , fueled by a perfect var_player[1][8][FTA] - var_player[1][8][FTA] night from the free throw line . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][1][PTS] on var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting and ripped down a game high var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds to complete his third double - double in the past four games . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[0][1][PTS] points on an efficient var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] shooting night . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][0][PTS] points and shot var_player[0][0][FG3M] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] from three - point land . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] led all var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] bench sscorers with var_player[0][5][PTS] points , and he dished out var_player[0][5][AST] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] just could n't get out in transition , as they scored just six fast break points , and they could n't generate second chances either , as they managed only five offensive rebounds . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to win consecutive games for the first time since November with their next contest Friday night in Phoenix . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have now lost four straight and will look to reverse things at home Friday night against the Nuggets .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] snapped a six - game losing streak as they defeated the host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) used a monstrous fourth quarter , including an 80 run in final two minutes in order to take a five - point lead and earn their revenge against the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) , who had defeated them in the first game of this home - and - home series , in new var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] earlier this week . Jeff Hornacek decided to go with his gut and roll with rookie point guard var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] in the fourth quarter , while leaving var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] on the bench . var_player[1][10][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][10][FTA] assists and var_player[1][10][STL] turnovers , as he helped fuel a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - 15 fourth quarter that saw the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] take their first lead since they led 34 - var_player[1][10][FG_PCT] early in the second quarter . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] went cold near the end of the game , missing var_player[1][0][REB] - of - 7 shots but totally made up for it as he hit a three to give the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] the 112 - 111 lead with 51 seconds left . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] both fouled out in the final few minutes but var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] came in to pick up right where the big men left off . Melo was the high - point man for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , with 26 points to go along with 10 assists and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] followed up with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks .

Meanwhile , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] saw their var_player[0][0][DREB] - game win streak come to an end despite , a combined var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] points from var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][0][FIRST_NAME] added var_player[0][0][REB] blocks , var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds , var_player[0][1][TO] assists and var_player[0][0][FG3M] steals , while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][1][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][FTA] steals . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was solid in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench , as he poured in var_player[0][5][PTS] points , along with var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][AST] assists , in his fourth consecutive game scoring in double digits . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , including var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long range but were not able to hang on for the full 48 , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] surged back to get their revenge . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] go on to host the Wizards on Sunday afternoon .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Philips Arena on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] were expected to win this game easily and they did just that by leading for the final 30 - plus minutes . Turnovers were var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's downfall , as they committed 21 of them , while forcing just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] from var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did work in the interior , as they won the rebounding battle , 48 - 38 and outscored the Sixers , 42 - 30 , in the paint . Shooting was also a key difference , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent , while the Sixers hit just 42 percent of their shots . The Sixers ( 15 - 27 ) have the worst plus - minus in the NBA without var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] in the lineup and losses like this show how much of a difference he makes . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] led Philly in scoring , tallying var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][FG3M] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][0][PTS] points and grabbed var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds en route to a double - double . T.J.McConnell stuffed the stat sheet by providing eight points , six rebounds , 11 assists and three steals . On deck for the Sixers is a home matchup with the Los_Angeles Clippers on Tuesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have now won nine of their last 11 games , as they continue to climb up the standings . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the player of the game , collecting var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][OREB] blocks on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] also recorded a double - double , totaling var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][FIRST_NAME] Schroeder scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while handing out a team - high var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][5][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] Jr. was a nice spark off the bench , providing var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][AST] assists and var_player[0][5][FG3M] steals . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will also host the Clippers for their next game , which will be on Monday .
These two teams have really struggled this season and the 48 combined turnovers shows just that . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was the more inept team though , as they set an NBA season - high with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] turnovers of their own . The shooting was n't any better , as they shot 41 percent from the field , 67 percent from the free - throw line and 22 percent from three - point range . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was the best player in this game , tallying var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] went just var_player[0][4][TO] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field , but still finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][4][TO] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also scored var_player[0][1][PTS] points , as all var_player[0][1][FGM] starters played at least var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was the only effective Nugget on offense , finishing with var_player[1][6][PTS] points and var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] had a game to forget , as he went just var_player[1][5][FGM] - of - var_player[1][5][FGA] from the field , en route to var_player[1][5][PTS] points .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 103 - 100 Thursday at Madison Square Garden . Coming off maybe their most impressive win on the season , a road victory against the Celtics , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had an opportunity to really step out of a funk and get on the right track at home . However , var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) ended up being too much for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on their own home floor . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with a team - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] steals in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . Otto_Porter_Jr . continued his hot streak as well , posting 23 points and six rebounds while going a scorching - hot 6 - of - 10 from behind the arc . As a team , all things were clicking offensively from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , with the team as a whole shooting var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-REB] percent from three as they notched their fourth straight victory . As for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , it was a disappointing result , especially with the return of var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] from an Achilles injury . The Latvian came off the bench to score 15 points in 29 minutes , but it was var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] that really kept the team in the team . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with a game - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting on top of var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] had his second straight solid game , as he finished with var_player[0][4][PTS] points . In the end , however , it was var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's inability to hit an outside shot that ultimately led to their demise , as they made just seven of their var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] attempts from long range ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look for their fifth straight win against the Pistons on Saturday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will remain home Saturday to take on the Suns .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Thursday night . Both teams came into this game in the midst of three - game winning streaks and both teams came in on the back end of a back - to - back set . It was clear there were some tired legs out there , as the shooting was off with a much lower score than anticipated . Both squads combined to shoot well under 40 percent from the field with the two teams combining to go 15 - for - 57 from three - point range while committing 19 turnovers each . What ultimately got var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] their win was an 180 run in the third quarter in which the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went nearly six minutes without scoring . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was able to fight back and get it to a tied ball game , but still could n't prevail late . Another huge key was the rebounding , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] snatched down var_team[0][TEAM-REB] boards to the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] . This snapped a 15 - game winning streak for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] over var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , which was one of the longest current streaks in the NBA . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has been struggling with their frontcourt defense all season and that became another huge issue tonight . It 's var_player[0][2][PF] thing to allow var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] to have a monster game , but allowing a rookie like var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] to record a double - double as well is unacceptable . No var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] player had a great game tonight aside from var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_player[1][1][REB] points , var_player[1][1][PTS] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] assists , var_player[1][1][PF] steals and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks in another spectacular all - around game . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] looks poised to make the All-Star team this year ad it 's because of his ability to stuff the stat sheet like he did tonight . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] has had a down year by his standards and he struggled yet again here , as he shot var_player[1][4][DREB] - for - var_player[1][4][FGA] while amassing just var_player[1][4][AST] points and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in the loss . In fact , he was benched for long stretches of this game , including the majority of the fourth quarter . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] gets a much needed day off on Friday and then they get a good matchup against the Phoenix Suns on Saturday in their next game . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has quietly been one of the best teams in the west over the last two months and wins like this show why . They now have wins over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , Los_Angeles Clippers and Oklahoma_City Thunder over their last three weeks and that 's indicative of how much they have improved over recent weeks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] has been the best player in the world in that stretch and he continued it here , by recording var_player[0][1][PTS] points , 15 rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists and var_player[0][1][FTM] steals in the win . All five starters scored in double - figures and that 's a great sign with var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] sitting out this game with a heel injury . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] did n't shoot well , but he did accumulate var_player[0][4][AST] points , 10 rebounds and var_player[0][4][PTS] assists in yet another triple - doubling performance . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to extend their winning streak to five games on Saturday against the Indiana Pacers .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] has been the var_player[0][2][BLK] dependable source of offense for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in a dismal first quarter of the 2015 - 16 campaign . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's big man has tallied double - digit points in every game , and was the top scoring center in the league entering Tuesday 's contest ( 20 points per game ) . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] spearheaded the offensive cause once again versus the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , collecting var_player[0][2][PTS] points and adding var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and a block . Even on a night where frontcourt partner - in - crime var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a down game by his standards , var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] demonstrated the ability to once again put the offense on his shoulders and carry the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to a second consecutive victory .

Not to be outdone , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[0][2][PTS] points and hauled in var_player[0][2][REB] boards , with almost half his scoring haul ( var_player[0][2][FGM] points ) coming during the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' comeback in the final period . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] came just one rebound shy of joining the double - double parade himself , registering var_player[0][1][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][REB] boards , a pair of assists and a pair of blocks . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently resides in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) handled the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . These were two teams going in opposite directions coming into Friday 's game and that fact ended up playing out on the court yet again . It was a 21 - point game at the half and the Sixers could n't really recover after that poor start . The biggest discrepancies in the game were the free - throw shooting and turnovers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] made 21 - of - 22 free - throws while the Sixers went just 16 - for - 22 and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] won the turnover battle 17 - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] . It was already ugly for the Sixers , but it 's getting down right atrocious at this point . What 's really hurting this team is their offense , as they rank dead - last in the NBA in scoring and lowered that average here . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] opted to go with a smaller lineup by bringing var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench , which is a strange move considering he 's arguably their best player . He still played 27 minutes and tallied 16 points and nine rebounds in the loss . The best player for the Sixers on this night was var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who totaled var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][FG3M] assists and var_player[1][3][FTA] rebounds in the defeat . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will look to grab that first elusive win in Miami on Saturday against the Heat . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are quietly one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now , as they have won var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] of their last 10 games . Much of that success can be credited to var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , but it was the mainstay combo of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] who got it done on Friday night . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists while var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] collected var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][PF] blocks in the win . Rookie var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] also had his best game in his short career , contributing var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][PF] assists in the victory . This is a dangerous team in the East going forward and they look like a threat to make the playoffs and possibly win a game in the postseason for the first time in 14 years . They 'll look to keep up this form against the Sacramento Kings on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at the TD Garden in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . After coming out of the third quarter down 76 - 72 , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't look to be in the best of positions . With a huge fourth quarter though , where the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] out - scored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] , they were able to secure the eight point victory at home in front of their home crowd . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] forced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] into var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , while committing only var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] of their own , which may have been the difference in this game . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received most of their production from their forward position , as var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] both had strong performances . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] led the team , scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FTA] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][BLK] - var_player[0][1][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FGM] FT ) and grabbing var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . The 27 points were a season - high for him , while it marked his second double - double in as many games . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] on the other hand posted var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][FTA] - var_player[0][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][BLK] - var_player[0][0][BLK] FT ) , var_player[0][0][DREB] assists , var_player[0][0][FG3A] steals and var_player[0][0][FTA] blocks . While the 22 points were a season - high for him , so were the blocks and steals , as he was a huge contributor on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball Monday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did receive plenty of help from their bench as well . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][7][OREB] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][PF] - var_player[0][7][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[0][5][FTM] - var_player[0][5][FTA] FT ) in only var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][7][PTS] points ( var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] FG , var_player[0][7][FG3M] - var_player[0][5][PF] 3Pt , var_player[0][7][FTM] - var_player[0][7][FTA] FT ) in 23 minutes . Both var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also reached double figures with var_player[0][3][PTS] points apiece . Despite the loss , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] received another huge performance from var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][1][FGM] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the floor to score var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocked shots . He was able to get to the line at will in this game , converting on 14 - of - 15 free throws . He 's had the hot hand lately , averaging 29 points and 10 rebounds per game over his last three outings . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had arguably his best game of the season , going var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the field and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][3][FG3A] from the three - point line to score var_player[1][3][PTS] points . It was a season - high in points for him , as he 's dealt with injuries for a large portion of the year . Coming off the bench with var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] back in the starting lineup , var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] still had a strong showing . He chipped in with 19 points ( 7 - 15 FG , var_player[1][4][BLK] - var_player[1][4][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][REB] - 6 FT ) and eight rebounds , playing just under 35 minutes because var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was forced from the game after only 15 minutes with a right ankle injury . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday .
The host var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] took down the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , in their season opener Wednesday . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] quickly jumped out to a var_team[1][TEAM-AST] - 3 lead to begin the game , leaving var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] in a tight spot almost immediately . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] answered with a lightning - fast run of their own , however , and managed to exit the first quarter trailing by only three points . While reigning Rookie of the Year var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][2][FGM] points in the first var_player[1][2][FG3A] minutes of the contest , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to keep him relatively quiet during the second and third quarters . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] still finished with a respectable var_player[1][2][PTS] points . Veteran center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] has called his toughest matchup , made this no easy feat , however , recording var_player[0][2][FTA] blocks to go along with var_player[0][2][PTS] points . Two other members of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's longstanding core , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , also contributed heavily in the points column , scoring var_player[0][4][PTS] and var_player[0][7][PTS] respectively . While var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's veterans drove the win , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] saw major contributions from their younger players . Third-year wing var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team in scoring , posting var_player[1][0][PTS] points , while high - flying young guard var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] dropped in var_player[1][3][PTS] . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] , meanwhile , added var_player[1][2][AST] assists and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds to complement his scoring output . The contest was also the NBA debut for rookie var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , the fifth overall pick in the 2016 draft . var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] played behind var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , clocking just var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes of game time . He contributed eight points and four rebounds during that time on the floor . The Wolves will visit Sacramento on Saturday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will take to the road to face the Knicks .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , at Target Center on Monday . Late in the contest , with var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] seconds left , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) held an eight - point lead and were seemingly well on their way to their 11th straight victory . But then , a couple of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] turnovers and a few big plays from var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] later , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) had var_player[0][0][OREB] last chance to either tie or take the lead with eight seconds remaining in the game . However , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] ' fallaway mid - range jumper would not go down and the time would expire , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] 's miraculous win streak remained alive . In the end , it was the var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] show in Minneapolis , with the point guard hitting nearly everything he threw up and finishing with a team - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting from the field and var_player[1][4][FG3M] - of - var_player[1][4][FG3A] shooting from behind the arc on top of var_player[1][4][FG3A] assists . And that hot shooting was contagious , as the rest of the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] players launched from three - point land with plenty of confidence and the team shot an astounding var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from long range , solidifying them as one of the hottest teams in basketball . As for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , they got impressive performances out of their var_player[0][2][STL] stars in var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , but they were unable to walk away with the victory in their second game without Zach_LaVine , who is out for the season with a torn ACL . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] finished with a game - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] ' late - game heroics and a 21 - point second half led to him finishing with var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting from the field . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] also had yet another double - double , scoring var_player[0][4][PTS] rebounds and dishing out var_player[0][4][AST] assists . Overall , it was an efficient game for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , who shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , but it ended up just being too little too late . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to make it 12 straight wins Wednesday against the Bucks , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look to avoid their fifth straight loss Wednesday against the Raptors .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 30 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in overtime Friday . Both teams saw several established starters struggle mightily with their shots , and relied heavily on a narrow core of their starters for the bulk of the scoring as a result . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was actually held scoreless until the fourth quarter , and finished with only var_player[1][4][PTS] points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] was similarly frustrated on offense , totaling only var_player[0][3][PTS] points on var_player[0][3][PF] - for - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were the beneficiaries of a third straight strong performance from power forward var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_player[1][1][PTS] points , including another var_player[1][1][FG3M] buckets from beyond the arc . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with a double - double that featured var_player[1][3][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][REB] boards . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the other main contributor on the night , posting a double - double of his own with var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . With var_player[0][2][PF] starters scoring var_player[0][2][PTS] points or more and a trademark double - double from var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were eventually able to pull away from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the extra period . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] notched var_player[0][2][PTS] points and complemented it with var_player[0][2][DREB] rebounds , while var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] poured in a game - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points on outstanding var_player[0][0][FG_PCT] percent shooting ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - for - var_player[0][0][FGA] ) from the field . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] posted his best performance of the young season as well , chipping in var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , and var_player[0][4][AST] boards . The loss dropped the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and into second place behind the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home to face the Orlando Magic on Sunday . The win raised the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] record to a perfect 30 and keeps them in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now enjoy a three - day break before their next contest , a home tilt against the Pacers next Tuesday .
It was business as usual for point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] earned their sixth win in seven games this season . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] shot just var_player[0][4][TO] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] and scored just var_player[0][4][PTS] points , well below his average , but posted a double - double with var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] turned it on in particular during the third quarter , in which he scored or assisted on all 20 points during a 200 var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] run . A more efficient double - double came off the bench , with center var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] scoring a team - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points on var_player[0][5][REB] - of - var_player[0][5][FGA] shooting to go with var_player[0][5][FGM] rebounds . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] played only var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes but still made a significant impact in the scoring column . For var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , bench scoring was a necessity , as the starting five combined for just 35 points on the night . Forward var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , while guard var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and forward var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] scored in double - digits as well .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) avoided losing their fifth straight by beating the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) by a score of var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] , Sunday , in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . The loss also ended var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's four game winning streak . Both teams were missing their starting centers as Jonas_Valanciunas ( hand ) and Tyson_Chandler ( knee ) were both out . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] led 81 - 72 heading into the fourth but a late surge from var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] brought them within buzzer - beater range , although this night , the second of a back - to - back , they could not get it done . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a great game for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , scoring a season high var_player[0][3][PTS] points on var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting , along with var_player[0][3][FTM] assists and var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued his strong play as well , with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FG3M] assists and var_player[0][0][STL] steals . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will ultimately need more help from the bench if they want to have any great success this season , var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] can not do it alone , although Valanciunas has been missed . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had three bench players score 15 or more points ; quite the contrary to Torontos who had no bench players score in double digits . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] was raining threes , shooting var_player[1][8][FG3M] - var_player[1][8][FG3A] from deep and finishing with var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][8][DREB] assist , in only var_player[1][8][MIN] minutes off the bench .

With the win , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also improved to 10 - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] at home on the season , placing them at above .500 at the Smoothie King Center for the first time in 2015 - 16 . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] squared off in what proved to be a battle between big men on Thursday . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] recorded a game - high var_player[0][1][PTS] points , while var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] poured in var_player[1][2][PTS] points , pulled down var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , and stole the ball var_player[0][1][PF] times . Despite var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's high individual rebounding total , the var_player[1][2][TO] teams ended up dead even on the glass , with each squad grabbing 44 rebounds . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] also went var_player[1][2][FTM] for var_player[1][2][FTA] at the free - throw line just var_player[1][2][AST] day after setting the NBA record for missed free - throws after going var_player[1][2][DREB] for var_player[1][2][MIN] in Houston . Shooting guard var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in scoring with var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] points in a game - high var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . The 22 - year - old ranks third in the league in minutes per game , and Thursday 's matchup saw no deviation from that trend . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , meanwhile , shooting guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] filled the stat sheet with a var_player[0][4][PTS] - point , var_player[0][4][AST] - assist double - double . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] also recorded var_player[0][4][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][4][FG3M] steals . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will travel to Denver for a matchup against the Nuggets on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will also play on Saturday , continuing the team 's homestead with a visit from the Milwaukee Bucks .

It was a wire - to - wire victory for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 17 - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , who have now won two in a row after a five - game losing streak . They were led by a monster performance from big man var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who posted a game - high var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FGM] - of - var_player[0][2][FGA] shooting , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][AST] assists and var_player[0][2][OREB] steals in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes .

Emanuel var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added a double - double of his own , recording var_player[0][4][PTS] points and a game - high var_player[0][4][AST] assists in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] played a wildly efficient game offensively as the team 's starting power forward , posting var_player[0][1][PTS] points on var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting from the field .

Overall for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , the problem was n't offense . They shot 50 percent from the field en route to posting their third straight total over 100 points and had seven different players score in double figures . Again , it was their lackluster defensive effort that made things too easy for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] offensively Monday . Up next , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will look for their third straight win against the Lakers on Tuesday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to turn things around in New_Orleans on Wednesday .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in the season finale Wednesday night at United Center , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] exploded out of the gate , scoring var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in the first quarter and 60 poitns in the first half , enough to take a nine - point lead into the break . But the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] offense completely collapsed in the third quarter , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] notched just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points in the frame and saw their nine - point lead turn into a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - point deficit , a big enough swing for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to coast to the finish line . The three - pointers were flying all day in this one , as the two teams combined to make 32 of their 59 attempts , a ridiculous 54 shooting percentage from downtown for the two squads . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] knocked down var_player[0][1][FG3M] three - pointers en route to a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point night to lead all scorers . Jrue_Holiday hit var_player[0][3][OREB] threes of his own and finished with 29 points , and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] notched a triple - double with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][FGA] rebounds , and var_player[0][3][PTS] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] percent from inside the arc but made 15 of their 24 three - pionters ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) , a relentless barrage that inevitably sunk the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with var_player[1][0][FG3M] three - poinit makes and var_player[1][0][PTS] points . Jerian_Grant finished with 20 points ( 7 - 14 FG , var_player[1][5][REB] - var_player[1][5][PF] 3PT , var_player[1][5][PF] - var_player[1][5][FG3A] FT ) and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench to add var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FG3M] - var_player[1][5][FG3A] 3PT , var_player[1][5][DREB] - var_player[1][5][FG3M] FT ) . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot well from three - point land ( 17 - 35 , var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent ) but were destroyed on the glass , as they managed just four offensive rebounds and were outrebounded overall 53 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday . In the extended absence of Victor_Oladipo ( wrist ) , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) have naturally depended heavily on perennial All-Star var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , and he 's validated their faith on countless occasions . However , others in the OKC supporting cast have occasionally stepped up to lessen the load on the dynamic point guard , and such was the case on Christmas Day . It was the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's pair of big men , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , who turned in var_player[0][2][PTS] and var_player[0][6][PTS] points , respectively , to supplement a game - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points from var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] , who also provided var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , a steal and a block . That trio of efforts helped lead to a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate from the field for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , which helped offset their var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were led by var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who supplied var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was right behind him with var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][0][DREB] steals . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , coming off a 40 - point explosion against the Sacramento Kings on Friday night , was relatively quiet with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , which he supplemented with var_player[1][3][AST] assists , a rebound and a steal . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was only able to muster var_player[1][4][PTS] points , but he did hand out var_player[1][4][AST] assists , haul in seven boards and record a pair of steals . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the second unit with var_player[1][6][PTS] points . var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , an assist and var_player[0][2][STL] steals to his aforementioned scoring total . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] registered var_player[0][6][FTM] rebounds , var_player[0][6][REB] assists and a steal in addition to his var_player[0][6][PTS] points . The starting var_player[0][4][TO] outside of var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][2][SECOND_NAME] provided precious little on the scoreboard , as var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] combined for just var_player[0][4][FTA] points . var_player[0][10][PLAYER_NAME] tallied var_player[0][10][PTS] points over var_player[0][10][MIN] minutes in a reserve role . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head down to South Florida to tangle with the Miami Heat on Tuesday evening .

Three bench players found double figures for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , as var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] all amassed 20 - plus minutes and var_player[1][9][FGA] - plus points .

They have been playing much more competitive lately , but this game was just one of those road blowouts that has become all too common with this team . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] had a nice game off the bench . var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] tallied var_player[1][6][PTS] points and var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds in just var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes of action .

Meanwhile , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the high - point man for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , with var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed up with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][2][PTS] points on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting , and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , in var_player[1][2][MIN] minutes of action .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Madison Square Garden on Friday . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] has begun to cede some of the offensive responsibility to sophomore sensation var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] in some games due to the latter 's emergence , and such was the case when these var_player[0][1][FGM] teams met just var_player[0][1][FG3M] nights prior . However , the perennial All-Star took back the mantle Friday , leading the way with 29 points , five rebounds , three assists and three steals . He also drained two key free throws with six seconds left , giving the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) their final two points of the night and effectively sealing the win . His stellar performance led the way on a night when the entire var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] starting five managed to hit double digits in the scoring column , and that also saw var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shoot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field overall . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) were paced by a var_player[1][3][PTS] - point output from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who complemented the scoring with var_player[1][3][FTA] assists , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and a steal . Karl Anthony-Towns totaled 20 points , eight boards , an assist and a trio of blocks . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][AST] assists , var_player[1][1][PF] rebounds and a steal . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] were only able to total a combined var_player[1][0][PF] points , however , taking only var_player[1][4][AST] shots between them . However , the bench helped make up for some of the offensive void by scoring 47 points overall . The second unit was led by var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who supplied var_player[1][7][PTS] points , var_player[1][7][FGM] boards and var_player[1][7][FG3M] assists . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][FTA] rebounds and an assist , while var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] contributed a var_player[1][6][PTS] - point , var_player[1][6][REB] - rebound double - double , along with var_player[1][5][REB] assists , var_player[1][6][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][5][FG3M] steals , over var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was second behind var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][REB] assists and a steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was outstanding in another start at center for Joakim_Noah , posting a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also featured var_player[0][2][FTA] assists and var_player[0][2][FTM] blocks . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] got the start at var_player[0][1][FGM] - guard and compiled var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FTA] rebounds , var_player[0][1][BLK] steals and a block , while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] came back down to earth with var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][FTM] rebounds , var_player[0][1][BLK] assists and var_player[0][3][FGM] blocks . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hit the road again Saturday , traveling to Charlotte to face off with the Hornets . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain home to take on the Sacramento Kings on Sunday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] at Staples Center on Wednesday . The rivalry match went in favor of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , even though var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] struggled on the floor of Staples Center again this season . Regardless which var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] team gets put on the court , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] is a surprising var_player[1][4][REB] - of - 28 across var_player[1][4][TO] contests this season . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] also had var_player[1][3][TO] of his worst games in a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] jersey , but the team effort led by var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][3][PTS] points and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 40 percent shooting from the field was more than enough to hold a var_player[1][0][FG3_PCT] point lead throughout most of the game . After a var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - pointer and a var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and - var_player[1][1][TO] layup with 2:10 left in the first quarter , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] went up by 15 points and did not have to look back . The closest the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[1][4][FGA] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came was var_player[1][4][FGM] points following a var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] jumper midway through the third quarter , which cut the lead to var_player[1][4][STL] points , but var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] ripped off a quick scoring run to put the game out of reach . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][TO] assists , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[1][4][PTS] points but failed to make a var_player[1][4][PF] - pointer on var_player[1][0][DREB] attempts and var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[1][0][FGM] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] from the field on his way to var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][4][STL] assists . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had the best all around performance after scoring var_player[1][1][PTS] points and grabbing var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , in addition to var_player[1][1][PF] assists and var_player[1][1][DREB] steals on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] provided var_player[0][5][PTS] points off the bench to lead all var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] scorers , but var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] combined for just 37 points on var_player[0][5][FG_PCT] shots from the field . The weak showing from the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] starters sank their hopes of pulling out a win against their rivals , and have now dropped five of their last var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] games . Next up , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Utah Jazz on Thursday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] host the New_Orleans Pelicans on Saturday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] , at Oracle Arena on Saturday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was expected to win this game easily with a 22 - point spread and they took care of business . A 100 run to end the second quarter was a huge stretch , as it gave the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] an var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - point lead , which they never relinquished from there . It was a near wire - to - wire win , as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's only lead was a one - point advantage for less than a minute in the second quarter . The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] recorded five more assists than the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , while committing five less turnovers . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] also dominated the rim protection , as they recorded var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] blocks to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's three . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( 8 - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) had a nearly impossible task here , but they did a nice job of hanging around and giving the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a battle . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a bright spot , as he accrued var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in the defeat . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] really struggled , as he could only muster up var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][TO] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists , while committing var_player[1][2][TO] turnovers on var_player[1][2][PF] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] was a nice spark off the bench , providing var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][6][AST] assists and var_player[1][6][FTM] steals . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double off the bench as well , amassing var_player[1][7][PTS] points and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds . On deck for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is a road matchup against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) have made minced meat of much of the league this season and a home matchup against an eight - win var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] team is simply unfair . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FG3M] rebounds , var_player[0][4][FG3M] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals in the absence of Kevin_Durant . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] accumulated var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][REB] assists . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[0][2][DREB] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , while nearly shutting out var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will face the Philadelphia 76ers on the road for their next game on Monday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 13 - 3 ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - 2 ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] in overtime of Game var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] of the NBA Finals Thursday in Oakland . The game lived up to all the hype , as the two teams battled back and forth from start to finish , but in the end , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] proved to be too deep and simply outlasted the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in overtime , where they outscored them 10 - 2 . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by the league MVP var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who , despite getting off to a slow start in the first quarter , still managed to finish with a team - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][STL] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt ) , var_player[0][4][TO] rebounds and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in var_player[0][4][MIN] minutes of play . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's most important contributor , however , might have been var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] off the bench , who was making big plays on both ends of the floor when his team needed them the most . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][5][PTS] points ( var_player[0][5][FGM] - var_player[0][5][FGA] FG , var_player[0][5][FG3M] - var_player[0][5][FG3A] 3Pt ) in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did not shoot the ball particularly well Thursday night , but still managed to finish with var_player[0][3][PTS] points on var_player[0][3][DREB] - of - var_player[0][3][FGA] shooting and var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][3][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] round out the var_player[0][1][PF] Warrior players who scored in double figures , scoring var_player[0][1][PTS] and var_player[0][0][PTS] points respectively . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was absolutely sensational in the losing effort , putting up an NBA finals career - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][FG3M] - var_player[1][0][DREB] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][AST] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) to go along with var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][0][FTM] assists in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes of play . With a majority of the guys around him struggling offensively , var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] did all he possibly could to keep his team ahead . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who came into the game with questions surrounding his injured knee , did not struggle offensively and put up var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][BLK] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt ) , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes of play . The bad news for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is that in the overtime period with the game seemingly already out of reach , var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] went down with what appeared to be a knee injury and limped to the locker room in a lot of pain . If var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] is unable to go , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are in even bigger trouble than they already were , as they will need a superman - like performance from var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] every game now , especially if he ca n't get the support he needs from his teammates . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] will have var_player[1][4][BLK] days to recover , as Game var_player[1][4][BLK] of the Finals is set for Sunday at var_player[1][4][FG3A] p.m. EST .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] managed to eclipse the var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - percent mark from the field and three - point range , and all five players hit double digits in the scoring column . The returning var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][0][PTS] points led the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] followed with var_player[1][4][PTS] points . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] posted a var_player[1][1][PTS] - point , var_player[1][1][FGA] - rebound double - double , and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[1][3][PTS] points . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] supplied a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound double - double and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] led the bench with var_player[1][2][DREB] points . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] turned in matching var_player[0][2][PTS] - point efforts to pace the Sixers . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][OREB] assist and var_player[0][0][STL] steals . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was back on the bench but contributed var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][5][DREB] assists over var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in var_player[0][1][FGA] points , var_player[0][1][PF] assists , var_player[0][1][DREB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][STL] steal .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . In a tightly - contested game , the rebounding and free - throw shooting ended up being the difference . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] outrebounded var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 45 - 35 and made var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent of their free - throws , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] made just var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent of theirs . These are two talented teams who prefer to play up - tempo , but that was n't the case here . With a projected total of 216 , the 192 total was surprisingly low . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has been a strange team this year , as they continue to win on the road and lose at home . They are now 6 - 2 on the road and 2 - 6 at home . Usually a young team like this only plays well at home , but there 's something unique about this roster . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] once again , who tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds in the win . They played this game without var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] , but var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] filled - in admirably . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] amassed var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][AST] assists in the victory . The 8 - 8 start is a fantastic sign for this rebuilding team and the future is extremely bright with all of these talented youngsters . The Wolves will look to keep this going against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Sunday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] played this game without superstar var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] and it clearly hampered them here . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] is usually asked to step up in these circumstances , but he had var_player[0][0][TO] of the worst games of his career . In fact , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] shot var_player[0][0][FGM] - for - var_player[0][0][FGA] from the field to accumulate var_player[0][0][PTS] points and var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds . With a game like that and no var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] in the lineup , it 's nearly impossible for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to win . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] did however get another spectacular game out of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who tallied var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds in the loss . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will need Boogie var_player[0][11][SECOND_NAME] back for their next game if they want a chance , as they have to take on the undefeated Golden_State Warriors on Saturday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Monday . Even without var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] ( illness ) , the Cavs had no trouble exerting their will on a considerably inferior var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] squad , and clinching a division title in the process . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] had been fairly quiet in recent games by his standards , but stepped up his role in the offense without var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] in the lineup . var_player[0][0][FIRST_NAME] managed his second triple - double of the season , posting var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][0][FTA] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] outperformed var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] in every major category , and played an outstanding defensive game overall . They also managed a 56 percent success rate from the field , and a 48 percent figure from three - point range . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were paced by a spectacular effort off the bench from var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] , who managed var_player[1][8][PTS] points , var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the starters , but it was only with a pair of var_player[1][3][PTS] - point efforts . The former also added four rebounds , three assists and three steals , while the latter managed a pair of rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . No other member of the first unit tallied double - digit points , but var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] did pitch in with var_player[1][5][PTS] points , var_player[1][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][5][BLK] assists , a steal and var_player[1][5][BLK] blocks in var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] remains in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and 7 games behind eighth - seeded Dallas Mavericks . They 're home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday . J.R. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] followed var_player[0][7][FIRST_NAME] ' effort with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][STL] rebounds and var_player[0][3][STL] steals . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] filled in admirably for var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] , producing var_player[0][1][PTS] points , var_player[0][1][DREB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][FTA] assists and a block . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] paced the bench with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][AST] assists and var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] remain atop the Eastern Conference , with a slim 2 game lead over the Toronto Raptors . They 're home again against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( 30 ) inched one game closer to advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinal round with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] victory over the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . After taking a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 33 lead going into the second quarter , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were held to var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] points in the second frame . For the second straight postseason , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] haunted the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with another clutch shot . This time , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] hit a game - clinching var_player[0][0][DREB] - pointer to give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] a six - point lead with 16 seconds left .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fell to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head back home and await the Atlanta Hawks for a Friday showdown . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] enjoyed double - digit scoring nights from each of their var_player[0][4][REB] starters , who were unsurprisingly led by var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . The All-Star point guard collected 19 points , eight assists , five rebounds , a steal and a block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was next in line with a var_player[0][1][PTS] - point , var_player[0][1][FG3A] - rebound outing , and took away the ball var_player[0][1][DREB] times on the night as well . var_player[0][2][FIRST_NAME] Hilario did a solid job in Gortat 's stead for the second straight contest , pitching in with var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][AST] assists , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][2][REB] blocks . He also had a trio of thefts , in what would become somewhat of a running theme throughout the game . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , likely starting his last game in place of var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] , was solid with var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][FGM] rebounds and a block , while amassing var_player[0][3][STL] steals as well . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] rounded things out for the first unit with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds , an assist and a steal . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] paced the reserves with var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][AST] assists and a rebound over a highly efficient var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes , and var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] looked good while pouring in var_player[0][7][FGA] points , hauling var_player[0][6][DREB] rebounds , dishing out var_player[0][6][DREB] assists and also collecting a steal . In total , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to induce a whopping var_team[0][TEAM-AST] turnovers from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , which they converted into 36 points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and moved into fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division .

He 'll have to continue with that scoring momentum if the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] want any chance at staying alive in this series . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was the biggest surprise in this game as he was very effective as a starter . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FTA] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][DREB] - var_player[0][4][FG3M] FT ) , to go along with var_player[0][4][AST] assists , which was just the second time all season he reached double - digit assists . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] was a big part in giving this team a spark in the second quarter , which is where he scored 10 of his var_player[0][4][PTS] points .

Both var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] were just as important in keeping the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in this game as var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was . var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] really had his shot dialed in . He went 8 - for - 10 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 23 points , to go along with six rebounds and three assists . He did receive a technical foul though after shoving var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] while he was intentionally fouling him . var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] , on the other hand , chipped in with var_player[1][7][PTS] points ( var_player[1][7][FGM] - var_player[1][7][FGA] FG , var_player[1][7][STL] - var_player[1][7][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][7][FG3A] - var_player[1][7][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][7][REB] rebounds while playing var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench out - scored the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' bench 49 - 31 , but it was n't enough to give them the win . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] really struggled on the boards , as they were out - rebounded 52 - var_team[1][TEAM-REB] . That included 16 offensive rebounds for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , which gave them multiple second chance opportunities . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] also were given technical fouls after they got into a tussle of their own .

On Sunday , the team simply failed to click on all levels , shooting just 43 percent including a disastrous 20 percent from beyond the arc . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had major issues with ball movement , racking up just var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists on the night .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] have been wading through a tough stretch of their schedule that will continue as they embark on a four - game Western Conference road trip Monday against the Phoenix Suns . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has dropped two straight games . Prior to their most recent losses , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went on a nine - game win streak in what will probably prove to be the easiest stretch of their schedule this season . Confronted with more top - level teams , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have buckled , and with Spencer_Hawes ( knee ) sitting out Saturday , they lacked depth in the frontcourt , putting an even greater onus on their starting lineup . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] returned from a 17 - game absence with an Achilles injury to play var_player[1][9][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored a game - high var_player[1][0][PTS] points , and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] turned the ball over var_player[1][0][FG3M] times in what was an all - around obtuse game for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] .

However , var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] had a chance to seal the win with var_player[0][3][FG3A] second on the scoreboard after he was fouled by var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] in three - point range , yet he missed the last of var_player[1][3][REB] subsequent free throws to send the contest into overtime knotted at 108 . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] made up for his late gaffe in the extra period , tallying half of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' 20 points to seal the victory .

With Taj_Gibson now in Oklahoma_City , var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] , who drained var_player[0][7][FG3M] of his var_player[0][7][FGM] baskets from long range , could be in for similar playing time going forward . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] was productive in a reserve role as well , posting var_player[0][5][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][5][REB] assists and var_player[0][5][STL] steals over var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes .

On the whole , though , it was a very good shooting night for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as the team hit over 50 percent of its shots and almost var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent from the line . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , it was an off night for the All-Star backcourt of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] . The var_player[0][4][TO] shot just var_player[0][4][FG3_PCT] - of - 34 from the field , including var_player[0][4][FG3M] - of - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from three - point range from var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] .

Next up the Wolves will head to Boston for the second game of a back - to - back , on Monday night . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will also face the second night of a back - to - back on Monday , as they will be visiting Chicago
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday night . This was a major mismatch on paper , but this game was closer than expected . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] actually made a huge run in the fourth quarter to nearly cap off a double - digit comeback . What killed var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] once again were it 's starters , as they amassed just 41 points between the five of them . That 's actually less points than var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] combined who scored 52 of their own . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have been one of the best teams in the NBA since December and that continued here . They got out to an early double - digit lead and never looked back after that . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] once again carried the load , as they combined for 52 points , 14 rebounds and 14 assists in the win . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] continued his fantastic bench production , as he scored var_player[1][9][PTS] points in less than var_player[1][9][MIN] minutes of action . It 's quite bizarre actually , considering var_player[1][9][SECOND_NAME] is ranked as var_player[1][9][PF] of the var_player[1][9][FGA] best big men in the NBA on a per - minute rate . They simply need to get him some more minutes if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] want to get to their full potential . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's next game will be on Wednesday against the Dallas Mavericks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are easily one of the worst home teams in the NBA , but they played well here . They are now just 5 - 17 at Target Center and it 's a wonder why such a young team is so bad in their home arena . In any case , most of their youngsters played great here , as var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] all scored at least var_player[0][6][PTS] points . var_player[0][7][SECOND_NAME] put in the most impressive line , as he accumulated var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][7][FG3A] assists in one of his best games of the season . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to get out of this slump in their next game when they take on the Houston Rockets on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) beat the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Thursday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] dropped just its fourth home game of the season and have now dropped four straight overall . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] started the second half with a var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - 1 run to gain an 11 - point lead mid way through the third quarter . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had big contributions from var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who combined for 60 points in the contest . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] entered the game without var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] , who was sidelined with a shoulder injury . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] filled in for var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] and had a productive night , scoring var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][FG3A] 3Pt ) to go along with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds .

It was a low - scoring game as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] met the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Thursday . Low scores have become the tendency for opponents of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] has been an absolute force on the defensive end .

It was not a good offensive night for either team , though , as both clubs shot under 43 percent on the night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' struggles were primarily a product of poor play from their starters . The starting five combined for only 32 points and four assists . Off the bench , sixth man var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][7][PTS] to lead the team . Rookie var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] had his second career double - double with var_player[1][8][PTS] points and var_player[1][8][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also forced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] into 19 turnovers , which only added to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ' advantage in the 23 - point victory . The trio of var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] really killed the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] could n't miss and went var_player[0][0][FGM] - for - var_player[0][0][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][0][DREB] - for - var_player[0][0][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a game - high of var_player[0][0][PTS] points .

It was good enough to lead the bench in scoring . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had all five starters reach double figures in points , but just did n't play enough defense to keep them close . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][0][PF] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds . It was the most points he 's had in the last seven games , so the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will hope it can boost his confidence even more . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][4][PTS] points of his own , but did most of his damage from the free throw line where he went a perfect var_player[1][4][FTM] - for - var_player[1][4][FTM] . He 's done most of the scoring for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the last two weeks , and it looks like it may continue . Rookie var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] shot var_player[1][1][FGM] - for - var_player[1][1][FGA] from the field to score var_player[1][1][PTS] points , while also chipping in var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) second - half defense propelled them toward a blowout win at home over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . The contest was close in the first half , with var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] keeping themselves within striking distance of the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] lead . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the second quarter after falling behind early , and they entered the half with a nine - point deficit . The second half was a different story , however , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] posted just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points in the third quarter and var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points in the final period . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to pull away with relative ease after var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] went scoreless from the 10:12 mark to the 5:13 mark in the third quarter . While shooting inside the arc went swimmingly for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , who hit var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent of their attempts from the field as a unit , three - point shooting did not go nearly as well . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from behind the arc on var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - of - 19 shooting . The three point shooting was going surprisingly well up until Monday , given the trio of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] 's career marks not being among the elite in the NBA . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] led the way for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][AST] assists and var_player[0][0][FGM] rebounds , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] added var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] points , var_player[0][0][STL] assists and var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] boards . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[1][0][FGA] points for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , to go along with var_player[1][0][FG3A] assists and var_player[1][0][FG3A] rebounds .

Guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had arguably his strongest performance of the season , scoring var_player[0][3][PTS] points while also pulling down var_player[0][3][DREB] rebounds and dishing out var_player[0][3][AST] assists . The All-Star got to the free - throw line 15 times in the contest , converting on 12 of those attempts .

The Sixers are likely one of the best elixirs for a losing streak , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were certainly in need of a victory coming into Sunday . They 'd lost four consecutive contests , and had seen their playoff seeding slip from third to sixth during that stretch .

He put up 30 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes , but the team shot just 42 percent from the field and 20 percent from beyond the three - point line . Despite an impressive top - six players on their roster , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are woefully thin on the bench , and the absence of Eric_Gordon ( shoulder ) has impacted their ability to win games more than it should , but coach Monty Williams has been unable to find a viable fill - in on his bench .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] only managed three points in the last var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] minutes of that third quarter , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] picked up the pace in transition and capped off a double digit scoring run . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] led the way with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][OREB] assists , var_player[1][2][STL] steals and var_player[1][0][STL] block , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[1][0][PTS] points of his own , to go along with var_player[1][0][AST] boards and var_player[1][0][AST] assists . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] was dominant from every inch of the floor , and that included an impressive var_player[1][2][STL] - of - var_player[1][2][FG3A] from behind the arc and var_player[1][2][FTM] - of - var_player[1][2][DREB] from the free throw line . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had no response once var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] got going , and the floor being spaced favored var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] to work off the dribble . Four var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters finished in double figures including var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who led the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] in that department with var_player[0][3][PTS] points , to go along with var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][TO] assists . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , the Seton Hall product , were the only var_player[0][4][PF] players on the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to finish with a positive plus - minus .

This game was a must - win for both teams as var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] are battling for one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference . While var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was n't exactly overwhelming on the offensive end , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was dreadful .

With the win , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] locked up the head - to - head tiebreaker over the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , which could be the deciding factor for the eighth spot in the East . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was already missing Cody_Zeller and Michael_Kidd-Gilchrist coming into this contest , and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] missed the second half with continued knee soreness . The dearth of depth was ultimately too much to overcome for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , and their usual scorers did not come close to their usual offensive production . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was held to var_player[1][4][FTA] points on var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][PTS] shooting and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][4][FGA] points on var_player[1][6][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][FGA] shooting . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to bounce back Saturday against the 76ers before a crucial matchup with the Heat on Tuesday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to pull away in the second and third quarters by playing a suffocating brand of defense . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] allowed just var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points over those two quarters , while pouring in 48 points themselves . var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] provided solid scoring numbers off the bench , combining for 28 points . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] leap - frogged the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] in the standings , but remain 2 games behind the Celtics and Heat and two games behind the Nets . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] only plays one of those teams , Miami , down the stretch . That matchup is on the docket for Sunday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday .

As the halfway point of the season has passed , and the upcoming all - star break is around the corner , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will likely look to start thinking about 2016 - 2017 and the NBA Draft because it was the same story with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , who picked up their 10th straight loss and dropped to 4 - 24 at home . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] played to the delight of the hometown crowd , and provided var_player[0][0][PF] of his better performances of the season , as he finished with var_player[0][0][MIN] points , var_player[0][0][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][0][FTA] assists on var_player[0][0][REB] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting in var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes .

The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] turned the ball over var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] times and var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] exploited the youthful var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] roster , specifically var_player[0][6][FIRST_NAME] var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] , who converted var_player[0][6][TO] of the team 's turnovers . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] contributed var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][6][AST] assist off the bench . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] strung together another double - double with var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , while his frontcourt partner , var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , finished with var_player[0][1][FTM] points and var_player[0][1][AST] boards in a weak showing from the veteran . var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] 's torrid shooting did not have a large impact on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] all around effort , as the frontcourt combination of var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who made his season debut on Friday against the Blazers , and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] points and 24 rebounds . Even more impressively , they combined to go 6 - of - 10 from behind the arc , which constantly kept the game far out of reach from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . Nobody else on the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] was nearly as polarizing as the var_player[1][7][BLK] forwards , but a bright spot came from rookie var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who finished with var_player[1][7][PTS] points in var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] minutes off the bench .

The loss snapped the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' NBA-record 54 consecutive home winnning streak .

The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took down the host var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Tuesday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) came off a convincing win on Monday by blowing out their hometown rival var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Tuesday . The starting backcourt of var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and J.J. var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] was dominant , with var_player[1][9][FIRST_NAME] pouring in var_player[1][4][PTS] points and var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] adding var_player[1][3][PTS] . Perimeter play was the driving force of the dominant win , as the Clips shot over 53 percent from the field while sinking 15 three - pointers . Another area in which the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] thrived was free - throw shooting ; the team reached the line 32 times and hit a whopping 28 free - throws on the night . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) are on a six - game losing streak and appear to be right where they want to be , as the team shut down many of its veterans for the remainder of the season in part due to desire to keep their own draft pick . Tuesday 's loss at Staples Center was a particularly brutal one , however , as the team fell to its divisional rival on its home court . The team shot just 63 percent from the free - throw line and went an abysmal 5 - of - 19 from beyond the arc . One bright spot for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , however , was rookie var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who led the team with var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FGM] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit Dallas on Thursday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Timberwolves on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday night . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got off to a hot start , as they scored var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points in the first quarter to take a 15 - point lead . They never really looked back after that despite allowing the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to crawl back in the third quarter . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] percent from the field and recorded var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists on their 44 made baskets . The game was tied heading into the fourth quarter , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] outscored the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] to var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] over the final var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had a tough task here as a double - digit underdog , but did a good job of hanging around all night . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] once again carried the load , as he tallied var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][DREB] assists and var_player[1][3][STL] steals in the loss . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] also played well , as he double - doubled in a var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][REB] - rebound performance . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have a quick turnaround , as they play the Portland Trail_Blazers on Wednesday in the second half of a back - to - back set . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] did n't play their cleanest game , but they extended their undefeated home winning streak to 23 games on the season . Steph Cwas the catalyst once again , as he accumulated 35 points , nine assists and five rebounds in the win . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the darkhorse hero though , as he double - doubled while also recording var_player[0][2][BLK] blocks and var_player[0][2][STL] steals in a defensive showcase . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's last game before the All-Star break will be on Wednesday when they play the Phoenix Suns .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got a good team effort in an easy win for them in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . No var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] player garnered more than var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] minutes or scored 20 points , but seven players scored in double - figures . They were led by Louis var_player[1][7][SECOND_NAME] , who put in a team - high var_player[1][7][PTS] points in var_player[1][7][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has the same record as the Chicago Bulls as they 'll battle for playoff position the rest of the regular season . The banged up Wolves played just eight players against the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Probably rookie of the year var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] was the man against his hometown team . He put in 25 points to go along with five boards , five assists , two blocks and one steal . His teammate rookie point guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] had a solid game with var_player[0][3][PTS] points and var_player[0][3][TO] rebounds but recorded var_player[0][3][REB] turnovers and just var_player[0][3][AST] assists . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] has lost five straight , they 'll play a home game on Friday before heading on a four - game west coast road trip . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Orlando Magic on Friday , as The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Friday . Perennial All-Star var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] was not expected to play after experiencing flu - like symptoms Friday afternoon . However , the veteran decided to tough things out and remain active in a reserve role , in an effort to help the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] put a halt to a recent cold spell that had seen them lose three of their last five contests . The move paid off , as the 33 - year - old collected 10 points , seven assists , two rebounds and a steal over just 19 minutes off the bench . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to dominate the contest with outstanding shooting and highly productive performances from their starters as well , as they tallied an impressive var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] shooting percentage from the field , and a solid var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . Meanwhile , their suffocating defense stymied var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to the tune of var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent tallies , respectively , in those categories . As evidenced by the final score and the aforementioned team shooting figures , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] obviously had significant trouble making a dent on the scoreboard , and their top scorer netted only var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] points . That player was surprisingly var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who did also add var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and an assist ) and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][9][FGA] points , var_player[1][1][FTA] rebounds , an assist and a steal ) were the only other starters in double figures points - wise , while var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] led the reserves with a pair of var_player[1][6][PTS] - point efforts . J.J.Barea , drawing the start for var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] , could only contribute six points and var_player[1][6][FG3A] assists . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] dropped to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] and currently resides in second place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home to face the New_Orleans Pelicans on Saturday . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's starting five was spearheaded by a monster double - double from var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] that was reminscent of many of his dominant performances from his breakout 2014 - var_player[0][2][DREB] campaign . The four - year pro managed 25 points and a season - high 19 rebounds , along with a block . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] poured in var_player[0][1][FGA] points and added var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][1][AST] assists , while var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] continued his recent stretch of solid offensive play with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][1][AST] rebounds and var_player[0][1][FG3M] steals . In addition to var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] 's strong performance off the bench , var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] made a splash with a var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - point , var_player[0][5][REB] - rebound , var_player[0][8][DREB] - assist effort over var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes that paced the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] reserves . While var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][5][DREB] rebounds ) drew the start in var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] 's stead , var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] got hot from the field and received some extra run as a result . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] and have vaulted into second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division by virtue of their victory and the Magic 's loss to the Wizards earlier in the evening . They now hit the road to face off against the Wizards on Sunday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) won a shootout Wednesday night over the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) at FedExForum , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] hit 17 three - pointers , a season high , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] set a season high in threes of their own with 13 and shot a brilliant 57 percent as they managed withstand var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's surprising offensive attack . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] points also marked a season high , the previous being 122 against Oklahoma_City way back in November . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] hit var_player[0][0][FG3M] three - pointers as he scored a team - high var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG ) for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][TO] - var_player[0][4][FG3A] 3PT ) and added var_player[0][4][AST] assists , and P.J . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] got into the three - point action , nailing var_player[0][3][FG3M] of his var_player[0][3][FG3A] attempts as he scored var_player[0][3][PTS] points . All five var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] starters finished in double figures , as did var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored var_player[0][7][PTS] on var_player[0][7][FGM] - var_player[0][7][FGA] shooting off the bench . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led all scorers with var_player[1][3][PTS] as he shot var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the floor and a brilliant var_player[1][3][REB] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] from three - point range . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][5][PTS] ( var_player[1][4][AST] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3PT ) and added var_player[1][4][FGM] assists and var_player[1][4][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][5][PTS] points in var_player[1][5][PTS] minutes off the bench . But the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] starting frontcourt of var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] combined to score just var_player[0][0][PTS] points against 51 for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's starting front court of var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , Jeff_Green and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] and var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will finish out this home - and - home series with a rematch Friday night at Staples Center .
var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] points led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , while var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][2][PTS] - point , var_player[1][2][PTS] - rebound double - double played a pivotal role in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - 38 rebounding advantage . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] combined for 31 points on the wings , while var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] compiled var_player[1][1][PTS] points over just var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes in a start at power forward . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] was nearly as efficient off the bench , supplying var_player[1][5][PTS] points over var_player[1][5][MIN] minutes . Overall , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] impressively posted var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with a pair of var_player[0][4][PTS] - point efforts , and the former notably drained var_player[0][4][FG3M] of his var_player[0][4][FG3A] shot attempts from beyond the arc . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other player to manage double digits in the scoring column , totaling var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][2][FGM] assists and five blocks .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday night . In a game between two of the fastest - paced teams in the NBA , the offenses were downright ugly tonight . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] came into this game ticked off with their defensive form and it 's clear they were letting out their frustrations on this beaten up var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] held the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to just var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting and drew var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers in a dominant defensive performance . The NBA has become a three - point shooting league , but these teams set the league back a few years by combining to go 15 - for - 55 from long range in this game . The aggressive nature of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] can be emphasized by the fact that they recorded 16 steals in the victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had lost four of their last five coming into this and a date with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] is just what the doctor ordered . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did n't play pretty basketball , but they got back to their roots and dominated with their stifling defense . The defensive total actually would have looked better if the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] did n't allow 16 points in the final three minutes in a comeback effort . No player played spectacularly , but var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] did put in a nice all - around game , as he tallied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][PF] assists and var_player[1][0][PF] steals in the win . Mighty var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] also gave the team a nice spark off the bench , as he finished with var_player[1][6][PTS] points , var_player[1][6][FTA] rebounds , var_player[1][6][AST] assists and var_player[1][6][FG3A] steals in just var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes of action . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] will have to keep up this defensive form in their next game against the Golden_State Warriors on Friday . This var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] team has fallen apart over the last two months and it 's quite clear that the offense is the main reason why . The amazing part about this game is that var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot 27 - for - 29 from the free - throw line and still barely cracked 90 points . That 's simply hard to do and it shows how inefficient they are playing right now . The one bright spot here was rookie var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored a career - high var_player[0][3][PTS] points in a shooting exhibition . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] finally seemed to be turning things around over the last few games , but he left here in the first quarter with a shoulder injury . That 's the last thing this team needs , as the injuries are killing them right now . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] really hurt his team tonight as well , as he went var_player[0][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from three - point range and committed a ghastly var_player[0][4][REB] turnovers in the defeat . It does n't get much easier in their next game , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] host the San_Antonio Spurs on Thursday in what will likely be another lopsided result .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Wednesday at the Staples Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Because both teams have already been eliminated from the playoffs , this gave each coaching staff another shot at evaluating talent for next season . It also cemented the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] into having the fourth worst record in the league , which means they 'll have the fourth best odds at getting the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] dominated this game , as they went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] percent from deep . It was the duo of var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] that helped lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] to such a large victory . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[1][3][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][STL] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][FTM] - var_player[1][3][FTA] FT ) , var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FG3A] assists , while var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] recorded var_player[1][5][PTS] points ( var_player[1][5][FGM] - var_player[1][5][FGA] FG , var_player[1][5][FTM] - var_player[1][5][FTA] 3Pt , var_player[1][5][TO] - var_player[1][3][FTM] FT ) and var_player[1][3][FTA] rebounds off the bench . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] has been very inconsistent all season long , so it was good to see him at least end with a strong performance . var_player[1][5][SECOND_NAME] also finished on a high note , as he combined for 42 points and seven rebounds over his final var_player[1][5][TO] outings . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3_PCT] - var_player[1][4][TO] 3Pt , var_player[1][0][FGM] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] was in the starting lineup and posted var_player[1][0][PTS] points ( var_player[1][0][DREB] - var_player[1][0][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][DREB] - var_player[1][0][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][TO] - var_player[1][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][0][REB] assists . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by a huge performance from var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] went var_player[0][4][FGM] - for - var_player[0][4][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][4][FG3M] - for - var_player[0][4][FG3A] from the three - point line to score a game - high of var_player[0][4][PTS] points , while also adding var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds . He 's been one of the few bright spots here at the end of the season for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as he 's averaged var_team[0][TEAM-AST] points over his final four games . He 'll likely find himself a role somewhere next season after showing what he can do on the court this year . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] also had a solid showing , finishing with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[0][3][FG3A] assists . With so many injuries in the backcourt , the second - year guard played the whole game Wednesday and took advantage , posting career - highs in points , rebounds and assists in just his second game for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] this season . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][DREB] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][STL] - var_player[0][1][PF] 3Pt , var_player[0][1][FTM] - var_player[0][1][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds as well . With both teams missing the playoffs , this marks the end of their respective seasons .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR2] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Monday at Philips Arena in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . While the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have already been eliminated from the playoffs , this game did carry some weight in regards to their 2015 NBA Draft lottery odds . The Timberwolves now have taken over as the worst record in the league , so they 'll likely end up with the highest odds come draft day in June for that number one overall pick . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , on the other hand , were n't affected much by the loss , as they 've already locked up the number one overall seed for the playoffs in the Eastern Conference . It still has n't been determined who they 'll play yet , but it should be either the Boston Celtics , Indiana Pacers , Brooklyn Nets or Miami Heat . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were the superior shooters in this game , going var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] finished at var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and just var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from deep . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] turned the ball over 18 times compared to just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] from the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , but they were able to overcome the disparity with their strong shooting . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] had an extremely impressive performance . He went 10 - for - 12 from the field and a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 26 points , while adding five rebounds and six assists as well . It was a complete turn around from Saturday 's game against the Magic where he shot just 25 percent ( 4 - 16 FG ) from the field , so the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were happy to see the guard play so well with the season coming to an end . var_player[1][4][FIRST_NAME] var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] Jr. also had a very strong showing , finishing with var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FG3A] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][FG3M] - var_player[1][4][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][4][DREB] - var_player[1][4][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][4][AST] assists over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . It was just the seventh time this season that he 's reached the 20 - point mark , as he 's averaging just 11 points on the season . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a big game with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][FG3M] - var_player[1][1][TO] 3Pt , var_player[1][1][FTM] - var_player[1][1][AST] FT ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][1][AST] assists over var_player[1][1][MIN] minutes as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' backcourt duo of var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] did their best to pull out this win for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FTA] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][OREB] - var_player[0][4][TO] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][3][FG3M] FT ) , var_player[0][3][FG3A] assists and var_player[0][4][STL] steals , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[0][4][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTA] - var_player[0][3][FTM] FT ) and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] has been hitting three - pointers at a very high rate as the season has been winding down . He 's made at least three three - pointers in six of his last seven games , which bodes well for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] as the playoffs begin Saturday . With Paul_Millsap getting the night off in hopes of having his shoulder return closer to 100 percent , both var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] put up some points in the frontcourt . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points ( var_player[0][0][FGM] - var_player[0][0][FGA] FG , var_player[0][0][DREB] - var_player[0][1][REB] 3Pt , var_player[0][0][REB] - var_player[0][0][FTA] FT ) and var_player[0][0][FTM] rebounds over var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes , while var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG ) and var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds over var_player[0][0][MIN] minutes . While the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' starters all played well , they just happened to run into the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] at the wrong time , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] played one of their best offensive games of the season . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' final game of the season will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Wednesday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) sent the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) to their second consecutive loss Saturday night , edging out a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] victory . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , which led by eight entering the final period , allowed var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] to get back into the game late , as a 12 - var_player[0][0][FTM] run spurred by var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] cut the deficit to just var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] with under a minute remaining . Three var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] free throws would put the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] up var_player[0][3][STL] with 12 seconds to play , but var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] responded with a lay - in to put the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ahead var_player[0][3][STL] with var_player[1][1][BLK] seconds remaining . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] inbounded to var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] on the ensuing possession but his three - point attempt was blocked by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] , the early MVP favorite , finished with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( 14 in the first half ) , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][1][STL] steals to pace Milwaukee . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[1][0][PTS] points , while var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] chipped din var_player[1][4][FGA] to go with var_player[1][4][AST] assists . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] contributed var_player[1][3][PTS] points in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] struggled to take care of the ball , committing 11 turnovers in the first half and var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] for the game . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who scored 22 points in the first half , led the way with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] had a var_player[0][0][PTS] - point , var_player[0][0][REB] - rebound double - double , and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][FGA] rebounds . Veteran var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][5][PTS] points in var_player[0][5][MIN] minutes off the bench . Next up , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] head to Los_Angeles to take on the Clippers on Monday in the first of a four - game road swing . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] travels to Cleveland to take on LeBron_James and the Cavaliers , also on Monday .
The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were unable to overcome the absence of var_player[1][12][PLAYER_NAME] , falling to the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Thursday night . var_player[1][12][SECOND_NAME] , who sat out with soreness in his knee , is var_player[0][0][FGA] - var_player[1][7][FGA] against var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] in his career , but could do nothing but watch from the sidelines as var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] stifled a late run by the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , whose var_player[0][4][AST] - game winning streak was snapped . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] opened up a var_player[0][6][FG3_PCT] - point lead early in the fourth quarter , courtesy of an 80 spree spurred by three - pointers by var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] . However , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] responded , as a var_player[1][0][FIRST_NAME] Dellavedova-led run brought var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] back to within var_player[1][0][DREB] with just under two minutes to play . Following a timeout , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to regroup , as var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's final eight points to put the game away . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , var_player[0][0][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][0][AST] assists , converting var_player[0][0][REB] - of - var_player[0][0][FGA] field goals . He continues to be on a strict 30 - minute limit , though it 's likely to be lifted in the near future . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] led the way with var_player[0][6][MIN] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG ) , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[0][6][PTS] points off the bench . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had just var_player[0][1][PTS] points and no rebounds before fouling out in var_player[0][1][MIN] minutes . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , which struggled to find quality shots without var_player[1][7][FIRST_NAME] , shot a paltry var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor but registered 30 free throw attempts , compared to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's var_team[0][TEAM-AST] . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] had a team - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG ) to go with var_player[1][4][AST] assists , and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][0][SECOND_NAME] , who drew the start in place of var_player[1][12][SECOND_NAME] , finished with var_player[1][7][MIN] points , including var_player[1][0][DREB] three - pointers . Both teams are on the first night of a back - to - back set . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] heads to New_Orleans to take on Anthony_Davis and the Pelicans , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] play at Minnesota .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Tuesday night . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] came in to the contest with a chance to improve their chances for better playoff positioning , as a win would put them one step closer to potentially moving all the way up to the third seed by season 's end . They did their part against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] , which was missing starting point guard var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] due to an abdominal strain . However , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was also short - handed , with rookie Justise_Winslow out with an ankle injury . All var_player[1][1][FG3A] members of the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] first unit made key contributions to the victory , with veteran var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] spearheading the charge with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][FG3A] assists , var_player[1][1][STL] rebounds and var_player[1][1][FTM] steals . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] had a solid night from the field overall , tallying a var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent success rate . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] followed var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] 's team - leading effort with a var_player[1][0][PTS] - point , var_player[1][1][FGM] - rebound double - double that also included var_player[1][0][FTA] assists . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] managed var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][PF] assists and a steal . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks and var_player[1][3][FTM] steals , while var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] matched the big man 's point total and also pitched in var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][FTA] assists . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] are now atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and are currently slotted in the third seed as well . However , they face off with the fifth - seeded Boston Celtics in TD Garden on Wednesday night , a game that will determine final playoff positioning for both clubs . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was paced by var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who compiled var_player[0][3][PTS] points , var_player[0][3][STL] rebounds and var_player[0][3][STL] steals . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] followed with a pair of var_player[0][0][FGA] - point efforts . The former added nine rebounds and an assist , while the latter supplied four rebounds , two assists , a steal and two blocks . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] , who garnered the start in var_player[0][12][SECOND_NAME] 's absence , pitched in with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][AST] assists , a rebound and a steal . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was only able to tally a modest var_player[0][2][DREB] points , but did haul in var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds and recorded a pair of steals and a block . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] are in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They 've clinched the eighth seed in the conference and will close out the season at Cleveland on Wednesday night .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) extended their lead on the Eastern Conference with a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] home win over the plummeting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) . In their third game since firing coach David Blatt , the Cavs ran circles around the struggling var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] on both ends of the floor . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] shot a whopping var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field while sinking 11 three - pointers and simultaneously forcing var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] turnovers . The team recorded an impressive 34 total assists , including var_player[0][0][AST] from star var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] . In addition to his role as distributor , var_player[0][0][FIRST_NAME] scored a highly efficient var_player[0][0][PTS] points on var_player[0][0][FTM] for var_player[0][0][FGA] shooting from the field and var_player[0][0][FTA] of var_player[0][0][FTA] at the line . Power forward var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] , who has been the subject of many trade rumors of late , also posted var_player[0][1][PTS] points along with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][1][AST] assists , var_player[0][1][FTM] steals , and var_player[0][1][BLK] blocks . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has been struggling mightily lately , winning just two of its last 19 games . With star point guard Eric_Bledsoe out for the season due to a torn meniscus , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] have given the reigns to their young core of players . Rookie var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] has shone in a starting role , and Wednesday was no exception . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] posted var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , and var_player[1][3][AST] assists , and turned the ball over just twice in var_player[1][3][MIN] minutes . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will have a day off before traveling to Madison Square Garden to take on the Knicks on Friday night . The Cavs , meanwhile , visit Central-Division foe Detroit on Friday .
The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] ) held off the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) for a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] victory at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] fought tough , but were unable to handle the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] stifling defense , particularly in the fourth quarter in which var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] managed just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] did an excellent job defending locking down Aaron var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] , while var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] each poured in var_player[0][1][PTS] points . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] padded its lead in the Eastern Conference standings with a sixth straight win - - the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] longest winning streak of the season was eight games earlier in the season . It was a solid effort from the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] without All-Star forward var_player[1][11][PLAYER_NAME] , who was sidelined due to an ankle injury , thought he was expected to play earlier in the day after shootaround . In var_player[1][11][SECOND_NAME] 's stead , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] turned to rookie var_player[1][1][FIRST_NAME] Porzingus , who poured in a team - high var_player[1][1][PTS] points on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting to go along with var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds . It was a nice bounce - back game for Porzingus , as the young big man had n't scored more than 20 points since Dec. 7 against the Mavericks . He also set a new career high with four 3 - pointers made . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] received a big boost with var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] returning to the lineup Sunday against the 76ers , but the superstar point guard has n't been very effective . He played just 19 minutes Wednesday and was limited to five points on 1 - of - 7 shooting from the field . It 's still only been var_player[0][4][TO] games since var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's return , so chances are he 'll need a few more contests to get back into the swing of things , which the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] can certainly afford considering how well they 've played lately . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] posted his fifth double - double of the season with var_player[0][7][PTS] points and var_player[0][7][REB] rebounds .
The var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] on Friday in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who has really picked up his game as of late , lead the way for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , recording a triple - double of var_player[1][2][PTS] points on var_player[1][2][PF] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting , var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds and var_player[1][2][DREB] assists . In his last four games , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] has been productive in multiple facets , averaging var_player[1][2][PTS] points , 9 points and 5 assists . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] lead the team in scoring Friday , putting up var_player[1][1][PTS] points on var_player[1][1][FGM] - of - var_player[1][1][FGA] shooting to go along with var_player[1][1][FTM] assists and var_player[1][1][DREB] rebounds . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] had var_player[1][4][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FTM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] shooting and var_player[1][4][TO] assists in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] recorded var_player[1][0][PTS] points on var_player[1][4][FTA] - of - var_player[1][0][FGA] shooting and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds in var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes as a starter . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] came off the bench for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] and scored var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] points on var_player[1][6][FGM] - of - var_player[1][6][FGA] shooting in var_player[1][6][MIN] minutes . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][7][PTS] ) and var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[1][8][PTS] ) round out the var_player[1][8][FG3A] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] who scored in double figures . The victory gives the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] a 2 - game lead over Houston for second place in the Western Conference , although they still trail the first - place Warriors by seven games . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] lead the way for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , scoring var_player[0][6][PTS] points on var_player[0][6][FGM] - of - var_player[0][6][FGA] shooting in var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes off the bench . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] was close behind and was only able to record var_player[0][1][PTS] points on a poor var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] shooting . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] fell just two points shy of a double - double , putting up var_player[0][2][PTS] points on var_player[0][2][FTA] - of - var_player[0][2][TO] shooting and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds in var_player[0][2][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][9][PTS] ) , var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][9][PTS] ) , var_player[0][9][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][PTS] ) and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][4][PTS] ) round out the var_player[0][4][REB] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] who scored in double figures . As a team , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] recorded just var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists to var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , and the loss moves them into seventh place in the West , but they still are just 2 games behind the fourth - place Trail_Blazers . Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will head home Saturday and take on the Trail_Blazers , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will head to Phoenix on Sunday and play the Suns .
The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) defeated the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Sunday at the AT & T Center in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . Both teams put up nearly identical shooting numbers in this matchup . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from the three - point line , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the floor and var_team[1][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from beyond the arc . The difference in this game came down to turnovers , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defense was able to force the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] into a season - high of var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] . It gave them enough of an advantage to seal the victory . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were led by var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who had a team - high of var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][FGM] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][DREB] - var_player[0][3][FG3A] 3Pt ) , while also recording var_player[0][3][STL] steals . He got to the free throw line 10 times , and converted on nine of those attempts . The five steals were a season - high , and the points were well above his season average of 13 points per game . With Tony_Parker sitting out , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] took his spot in the starting lineup as the point guard . He shot well , going 6 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 14 points in 34 minutes . He also had six rebounds and four assists . But without Parker , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] also leaned on their other veterans with both var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] getting plenty of touches . var_player[0][1][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][1][PTS] points ( var_player[0][1][FGM] - var_player[0][1][FGA] FG , var_player[0][6][TO] - var_player[0][6][DREB] FT ) and var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , while var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] came off the bench to score var_player[0][6][PTS] points ( var_player[0][6][FGM] - var_player[0][6][FGA] FG , var_player[0][1][TO] - var_player[0][6][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[0][6][FTM] - var_player[0][6][TO] FT ) and var_player[0][1][PF] assists . It was a nice win for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] over a quality opponent . Despite taking the loss , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] had a few players that played well . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , going var_player[1][3][FGM] - for - var_player[1][3][FGA] from the floor and var_player[1][3][FG3M] - for - var_player[1][3][FTA] from the three - point line to score a game - high of var_player[1][3][PTS] points . He also added five assists , but uncharacteristically turned the ball over nine times , which was the most he 's had all season . He was a big reason for the team turnover difference that really hurt the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Coming off the bench , var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] came out firing . He went 8 - for - 11 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to score 25 points . It was a season - high for var_player[1][6][SECOND_NAME] , as he seemingly could n't miss for the majority of the game . The other big contribution came from var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] who had a monster line of var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds .

The var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] ) needed a torrid second half shooting performance to defeat the var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] on Saturday at the Verizon Center . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] led by as many as var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] early in the third quarter before var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] woke up and went on a var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - 6 run to narrow the gap . var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] , who came over to var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] from var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] at the trade deadline , canned the go ahead var_player[0][8][PTS] early in the fourth and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] never looked back . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] fouled out with 5:33 remaining and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] could never recover , managing just var_player[1][2][FGM] points for the rest of the game . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's brutal eight - game road trip finally came to an end in var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] on Saturday . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went just 2 - 6 on the trip to fall further towards the bottom of the Western Conference . var_player[1][10][PLAYER_NAME] did not suit up for this game after suffering a strained patellar tendon Friday . His replacement , var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , managed only var_player[1][0][FGA] points and a rebound over var_player[1][0][MIN] minutes on the floor . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will return home on Monday to host the Hawks . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were facing their second straight opponent that was at less than full strength after playing a Memphis team that rested three starters on Thursday . It looked ugly early on , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] managed to shift into high gear to escape with a win . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] put on a show with var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][11][PLAYER_NAME] Hilario missed his second straight game due to personal reasons and is questionable for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's next outing . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the Trail_Blazers on Monday before embarking on a four - game Western Conference road trip .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] got off to a quick start during their 2015 - 16 season opener , grabbing a nine - point lead by halftime . After out - scoring the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] in the third quarter as well , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] put the game out of reach and pushed on to their first victory of the season . As a team , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] went var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and an impressive var_team[1][TEAM-REB] percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks finished at 39 percent from the field and just 25 percent from deep . With Chandler_Parsons ( knee ) still out , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] moved var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] over to small forward , which gave var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] the opportunity to enter the starting lineup at shooting guard . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] made the most of his opportunity and torched the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] for a game - high of var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] points ( var_player[1][3][FGM] - var_player[1][3][FGA] FG , var_player[1][3][FTA] - var_player[1][3][FG3A] 3Pt , var_player[1][3][PF] - var_player[1][3][FG3M] FT ) , while also pitching in with var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] averaged just var_player[1][3][REB] points and var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] assists over 29 games with the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] last season , so this was a fantastic performance for the guard . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] added var_player[1][4][PTS] points ( var_player[1][4][FGM] - var_player[1][4][FGA] FG , var_player[1][4][DREB] - var_player[1][4][DREB] 3Pt ) , six rebounds and an assist in his var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' debut . He had to leave the game in the third quarter with a left knee contusion , though , so we 'll have to wait and see if it forces him to miss any additional time . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][1][PTS] points ( var_player[1][1][FGM] - var_player[1][1][FGA] FG , var_player[1][1][BLK] - var_player[1][1][STL] 3Pt ) and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds as well . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' starting frontcourt trio of P.J . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] really struggled in this var_player[0][1][DREB] . They went a combined 3 - of - 11 from the field for just nine points , which clearly was the difference in this one . The backcourt combination of var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] was about all the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had going for them . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] finished with var_player[0][3][PTS] points ( var_player[0][3][REB] - var_player[0][3][FGA] FG , var_player[0][3][FG3M] - var_player[0][4][PF] 3Pt , var_player[0][3][FTA] - var_player[0][3][FTM] FT ) , var_player[0][3][TO] rebounds and var_player[0][3][AST] assists , while var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][3][FGA] points ( var_player[0][4][FGM] - var_player[0][4][FGA] FG , var_player[0][4][BLK] - var_player[0][3][FTM] 3Pt , var_player[0][4][FTM] - var_player[0][4][FTA] FT ) , var_player[0][4][FGM] rebounds and var_player[0][4][REB] assists . var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] did turn the ball over var_player[0][3][TO] times , which was a big factor in pushing the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to a whopping var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] turnovers as a team.The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' 13th overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft , var_player[0][12][PLAYER_NAME] , shined in his professional debut , as he went var_player[0][3][REB] - for - var_player[0][12][FGA] from the field and var_player[0][3][OREB] - for - var_player[0][3][FTA] from the three - point line for var_player[0][12][PTS] points over var_player[0][12][MIN] minutes .

This victory gave the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 43 - straight win in their home building and they used an unlikely recipe . Usually the defense wins them their games , but the offense was on point on Thursday . In fact , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field , var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent from the free - throw line and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . The ball movement was superb as well , with var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] recording var_team[0][TEAM-AST] assists on 45 made baskets . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] has been struggling recently and this is the last place you want to play in those instances . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] continued their great seasons though , as they scored nearly half the points in this loss . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][3][PTS] points , with var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] scoring var_player[1][4][PTS] of his own . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] had a nice all - around game , as he totaled var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][FGA] rebounds and var_player[1][2][AST] assists in the defeat .

That home record has a huge test approaching , as the Golden_State Warriors come to town on Saturday for their next scheduled game .

After a 132 - 120 overtime defeat on Sunday in var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] came in to Wednesday looking to turn the tables .

Despite the victory , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] - var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] ) did not get off to the best start against a depleted var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] ) squad . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] struggled to get a lead over var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] and did n't pull ahead until there was just over var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] minutes left in the second period . From there , it was a game of runs as the teams traded leads before the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were able to hold off one last push of desperation by var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] did , however , lose var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] late in the third quarter , as he left the game with a left quad contusion and did not return .

Rookie point guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] scored a career - high var_player[1][4][PTS] points , but after he made a var_player[1][4][TO] - point field goal to put the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] up 75 - var_player[1][4][FG_PCT] with 11 minutes left in the game , var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] coach Dave Joerger put var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] on the rookie , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] roared back , with var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] bottled up so bad that he only got off var_player[1][4][PF] more shots the rest of the way and missed both of them . Still trailing 87 - 86 with 1:50 left in the game , var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] stole the ball on a bad pass from var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] , and var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] ended up being fouled , which sent him to the line to knock down both of his free throws and give the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] the lead they would never relinquish . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will travel to New_Orleans to play the Pelicans on Saturday , and the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will return home to host the Mavericks on Sunday , when they will try to stop their four - game skid .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] largely accomplished their unlikely feat by going through the weak spot of the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ' otherwise formidable defense , the frontcourt . As has often been the case this season , var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] dominated down low with a pair of double - double efforts . var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] led all scorers with a season - high var_player[1][2][PTS] points , and added var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][AST] assists , a steal and a block for his sixth double - double in the last seven games .

While var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] matched them in scoring down low and actually bested them by var_player[1][2][STL] board in the latter category , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's mammoth offensive showing played an integral role in allowing var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to escape with a hard - fought victory .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] improved to var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] but remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division .

However , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] could only drain var_player[0][4][FTA] of the var_player[0][4][FG3A] three - point shots he attempted , and missed a 27 - footer with var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] seconds left that would have closed the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] deficit to three at the time . The dependable var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] did pick up a technical for a scuffle with var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] , but also put up var_player[0][0][PTS] points and hauled in var_player[0][0][REB] boards . He also handed out three assists and recorded a pair of steals . While the other var_player[0][1][FGM] starters could only muster single - digit scoring , var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] did supplement his var_player[0][1][DREB] points with var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][8][PLAYER_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] reserves , who scored 41 as a group , with var_player[0][6][PTS] and var_player[0][6][FGA] points , respectively . var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] added var_player[0][8][FTA] rebounds and var_player[0][6][FG3A] assists , while var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] pitched in with var_player[0][8][FGM] boards , an assist and var_player[0][8][FG3A] steals . Two of var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] 's thefts came in the final 19 seconds , but the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were only able to convert those into var_player[0][4][FG3M] points in the form of a var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] field goal off the rebound of var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] ' aforementioned three - point miss . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] fell to var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] but remains in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division .

He did turn the ball over var_player[1][4][TO] times though and received a technical for throwing the ball in frustration at the referee , so var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] did n't necessarily have the type of success that he had hoped coming into the 2015 NBA Playoffs and he ends his season in disappointing fashion . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] nearly recorded a double - double with var_player[1][2][PTS] points ( var_player[1][2][FGM] - var_player[1][2][FGA] FG , var_player[1][2][FTM] - var_player[1][2][FTA] FT ) and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds .

Up next , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will look to earn their sixth straight win of the season against the Celtics on Friday , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will hope to end their var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] - game losing streak Friday against the Nuggets .
The league 's top two scorers squared off in epic proportions on Sunday as the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defeated the visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) now sit at five games above .500 and are narrowly trailing the Rockets and Grizzlies for the fourth - best record in the Western Conference . The bigger story from Sunday , however , was point guard var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's fifth straight triple - double . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] scored var_player[0][4][PTS] points , had a whopping var_player[0][4][REB] rebounds , and dished out var_player[0][4][AST] assists . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's streak of five games with a triple - double is the best of his career and the longest since Michael Jordan 's seven - game streak in 1989 . The All-Star 's effort helped to propel the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] to victory on Sunday , though solid perimeter defense advanced the team 's cause . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] were held to under var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent shooting from the field and 6 - of - 28 from three - point range . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] offense , meanwhile , shot almost 47 percent on the night , with solid contributions from guard var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][3][FGA] points ) and bench big man var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] ( var_player[0][6][PTS] points , var_player[0][6][REB] rebounds ) .

In addition to the scoring output , var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] had var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][1][AST] steals , and var_player[1][1][BLK] blocks . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] struggled aside from var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] , however , as the rest of the starting var_player[1][1][OREB] combined for just var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR3] points . The team also saw a rebounding deficit despite var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] 's strong performance on the boards , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] held a var_team[0][TEAM-REB] - 51 advantage on the glass . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will visit the Atlanta Hawks on Monday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will host the Memphis Grizzlies .

On defense , var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was able to hold var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to just 36 percent shooting and six three - pointers . Anchoring the team 's defense was center var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , who recorded var_player[0][2][BLK] blocked shots and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds , both team highs . For the second night in a row , the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_player[1][4][FTM] ) and guard var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] underwhelmed . var_player[1][4][SECOND_NAME] led the team with var_player[1][4][PTS] points but shot an abysmal var_player[1][4][FGM] - of - var_player[1][4][FGA] from the floor with var_player[1][4][DREB] turnovers . The guard also played below his averages on the glass and in the assist column , recording only six rebounds and five assists . Those numbers were also team highs , however , as the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] struggled to move the ball or crash the glass against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's tough interior lineup . The team shot only 36 percent and had just 14 assists on the night . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] will host the last - place Dallas Mavericks on Friday , while the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will take on the Phoenix Suns on Saturday .

However , he also committed a game - high nine turnovers . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] compiled var_player[1][2][PTS] points and var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , while var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] went for var_player[1][3][PTS] points . var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[1][5][PTS] points while taking a whopping var_player[1][5][FG3A] of his var_player[1][5][FGA] shot attempts from beyond the arc .

He was far from the only contributor however , as J.R. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] and var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] also notably stepped up in the absence of their All-Star point guard . The victory helped the Cavs open up a 4 - game lead over the idle Toronto Raptors for the top seed in the Eastern Conference with five games to play . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will have to keep their knife sharpened for at least a couple of more contests , as their remaining games include four opponents who will be fighting for playoff position .

The subject of trade rumors and victim to a notable slump for most of January , var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's 2016 had n't exactly gotten off to the best of starts . However , the 27 - year - old point guard had slowly begun crawling his way back to prominence over the four games prior to Monday , averaging a solid 16 points per contest during that span . Monday 's matchup against a var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] defense that had struggled against point guards this season proved to be the final domino to fall in var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's resurgence , as he managed a season - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points , and complemented them with var_player[0][4][AST] assists , var_player[0][4][FG3M] rebounds and a steal over var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] highly efficient minutes . Having totaled a modest var_player[0][4][FGM] points in the first half as var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] built a var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] - 46 lead , var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] tallied 13 points in the third quarter alone , helping the home team emerge from the period with a commanding 86 - 73 lead they would n't surrender . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ' attack was led by var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] , who continued a recent string of considerably productive play .

The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home for a date with the Miami Heat on Wednesday . var_player[0][4][SECOND_NAME] 's prolific night was seconded by a var_player[0][3][PTS] - point contribution from var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] , who also posted var_player[0][4][FTA] assists , var_player[0][3][FTM] rebounds and a block . The sharpshooting two - guard 's performance was a notable departure from his previous pair of contests , when he 'd managed six points against the Pacers and then was held scoreless versus the Heat . var_player[0][7][PLAYER_NAME] made it a successful night for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] point guards by collecting var_player[0][7][PTS] points , var_player[0][7][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][7][REB] assists and a steal off the bench in just var_player[0][7][MIN] minutes of action . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] had a rare quiet night on the scoreboard with only var_player[0][1][PTS] points , but did manage to pull down var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , dish out var_player[0][1][BLK] assists and record var_player[0][1][FTM] blocks . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was able to put together a var_player[0][2][PTS] - point , var_player[0][2][DREB] - rebound performance against var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] 's tough defense , and also added a pair of assists and a rejection .

It 's often said that a change of scenery can do wonders for a player 's outlook and consequently , his performance .

In just his second game in a var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] uniform , var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] paced the starting unit with var_player[0][0][PTS] points , and added var_player[0][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[0][0][DREB] assists and a block , his second performance of 20 points or more in var_player[0][0][TO] games in South Florida . He was an integral part of a historic shooting performance for the home squad , which tallied a 68 percent success rate from the field , including 50 percent from beyond the arc . Not only was it the top team shooting night to date in the 2015 - 16 campaign , but also the 17th - best such effort in the last 50 seasons . The var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] points also represented var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's highest scoring tally of the season . Lost in the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] 's offense 's coming - out party was a pretty fair showing on the scoreboard by the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . Seven var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] players - - var_player[1][4][FTM] starters and var_player[1][4][TO] reserves - - managed double - digit scoring , led by var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] 's var_player[1][4][PTS] points . He added three assists and a steal , in his first game back from the hamstring ailment that had caused him to miss the three previous contests . var_player[1][8][PLAYER_NAME] followed with a var_player[1][8][PTS] - point performance that paced the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ' bench , and that also included a pair of rebounds and an assist . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was next with a near double - double , registering var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][FGM] assists and a block . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds , an assist and a steal , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] amassed var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds and an assist . var_player[1][7][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] were the other var_player[1][7][OREB] reserves with double - digit scoring , as they each contributed var_player[1][6][PTS] points .

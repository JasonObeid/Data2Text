After tying the game late , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ultimately found themselves down one with 1 seconds remaining on the game clock . var_player[1][9][PLAYER_NAME] , without a teammate open , threw a pass off a defender 's back and drained a jumper off the glass , but it ended up leaving his hands long after the buzzer had sounded . In their victory , the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] got a pair of nearly perfect performances off the bench Thursday night , with var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] continuing his hot streak off the bench , and var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] putting together his best performance of the season . var_player[0][5][SECOND_NAME] finished with a team - high var_player[0][5][PTS] points on var_player[0][6][DREB] - of - var_player[0][5][FGA] shooting , while var_player[0][6][SECOND_NAME] , recorded a double - double of var_player[0][6][PTS] points and 18 rebounds in just var_player[0][6][MIN] minutes .

In a back - and - forth contest between division rivals , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] saved its best for the fourth quarter to put the game out of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ' reach . var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] could n't shake off his shooting slump at a crucial moment in the fourth , missing an open look from three that could have tied the game with under 30 seconds remaining . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] did n't quite sustain the momentum from Wednesday 's 51 - point outing against Sacramento , but was still able to put up var_team[1][TEAM-AST] points along with var_player[1][3][AST] assists and var_player[1][3][DREB] rebounds . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] had a strong outing of var_player[1][0][PTS] points and var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds .

The first three quarters of action were tight knit and many var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] defensive breakdowns and mistakes pretty much kept the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] within striking distance . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] and C.J . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] practically shot var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] out of the game , and the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] were able to rally behind a dominant fourth quarter performance . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] outscored var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] - var_team[1][TEAM-AST] down the stretch and coach Doc var_player[0][8][SECOND_NAME] ' squad proved a needed ability to close out tight games against tough opponents late in games . The problem for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] has been consistent throughout previous playoffs runs and during this past regular season , but var_player[0][12][FIRST_NAME] and J.J. var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] were not having any of that in Game var_player[0][4][FG3M] . var_player[0][12][FIRST_NAME] went on to finish with var_player[0][4][PTS] points , var_player[0][4][FG3A] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][REB] steal on var_player[0][4][FGM] - of - var_player[0][4][FGA] shooting , while var_player[0][3][SECOND_NAME] rounded out the backcourt with an var_player[0][3][PTS] points , which included var_player[0][4][FTA] shots from behind the arc . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] was unable to find his touch under the rim , but still managed a lowly a var_player[0][2][PTS] points to go alongside a monstrous var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . Recent Sixth Man of the Year award winner var_player[0][5][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in var_player[0][5][PTS] points off the bench in 26 minutes of action . LIllard and var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] jacked up 39 shots , but only connected on 12 of them combined as the duo finished with 33 points , but it was far from efficient shooting to keep their team in the game when it mattered most . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] stepped up where the backcourt could not and added var_team[1][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] points and var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds , to go along with var_player[1][2][FTM] assists in the stat stuffed box score , but the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] shot just var_team[1][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field as a unit . The series will move back to var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] for Game 3 on Monday .

With that said , var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] led for nearly the entirety of the game , with the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] never leading by more than two points . All the statistics favor the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] , as they won the shooting percentage , rebounding battle , fastbreak points , points in the paint and assist - to - turnover ratio . A big factor for var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was their poor free - throw shooting , as they shot var_team[0][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent on 12 attempts , to var_team[1][TEAM-FT_PCT] percent on 19 attempts for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) was dominated in many of the statistics , but they won the one that mattered most . var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] continued his scoring exhibition , as he tallied var_player[1][3][PTS] points , var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][3][AST] assists on var_player[1][3][FGM] - of - var_player[1][3][FGA] shooting . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] was second on the team , accumulating var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][4][AST] assists and var_player[1][4][STL] steals in the victory . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] finished with var_player[1][2][PTS] points , while var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] scored var_player[1][0][PTS] .

These are two defensive - minded teams and that showed with both of these offense struggling mightily in this matchup . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] was especially bad , as they shot var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field and var_team[0][TEAM-FG3_PCT] percent from three - point range . The key for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] was the assist - to - turnover ratio , as they recorded var_team[1][TEAM-AST] assists to just var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] turnovers , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] committed var_team[0][TEAM-AST] turnovers to just var_team[0][TEAM-TOV] assists . This was a near wire - to - wire win for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] , as the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] never tied or led after the first quarter . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( 18 - 13 ) came into this game losing four of their last five , so a road win is just what the doctor ordered . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] was easily the player of the game , as he tallied var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][2][AST] assists , var_player[1][2][STL] steals and var_player[1][2][BLK] blocks on var_player[1][2][FGM] - of - var_player[1][2][FGA] shooting . In fact , var_player[1][2][SECOND_NAME] was the only var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] player to score more than 10 points , as they had var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] players score between var_player[1][2][REB] and 10 points . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was the only other player in double figures , as he amassed var_player[1][1][PTS] points and var_player[1][1][REB] rebounds in the win . var_player[1][6][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] played all the point guard minutes and combined for 18 points , var_player[1][6][PTS] rebounds and var_player[1][4][FGA] assists . On deck for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] is a home matchup against the Houston Rockets on Friday . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-AST] ) is in the midst of their worst stretch of the season and this marks their fourth - straight loss by at least 12 points . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] left in the first three minutes due to a leg injury , but returned to drop a team - high var_player[0][4][PTS] points and var_player[0][4][AST] assists in the defeat . var_player[0][6][PLAYER_NAME] matched that var_player[0][6][PTS] - point total , as he added var_player[0][6][FGM] rebounds off the bench . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] recorded a double - double , totaling var_player[0][2][PTS] points and var_player[0][2][REB] rebounds . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] did score var_player[0][1][PTS] points and grab var_player[0][1][REB] rebounds , but went just var_player[0][1][FGM] - of - var_player[0][1][FGA] from the field . var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will look to get out of this slide on Friday in a tough matchup against the Golden_State Warriors .
The visiting var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] took down the var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Monday , var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-PTS] . var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] ( 19 - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) was relieved to win the close game after losing its last contest on a questionable call in the final minute against Chicago . Superstar center var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] voiced his disdain through sarcastic praise of the referees to the media . var_player[1][1][SECOND_NAME] did not let the frustration carry over to the court , however , as he continued his consistently strong play . The All-Star led the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] with 22 points , var_team[1][TEAM-TOV] rebounds , six assists , two steals , and a block against var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] . His rebounding effort helped the team earn a strong seven - rebound advantage on the glass , a difference that ended up helping var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] to take the game . For var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] ( var_team[0][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) , the win does not help the team 's effort to push into the wide - open bottom of the Eastern Conference playoff race . The var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] had sat just one game back of the eighth seed , but now trail Chicago by a game and a half . Most things went right for the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] on Monday , as the team came out for a strong var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR1] - point first quarter and finished shooting var_team[0][TEAM-FG_PCT] percent from the field . The team hit ten three - pointers and dished out a stellar 27 assists as well . However , a weak bench performance , both on offense and on the glass , ended up hampering the efforts of var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] 's starting five . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] will visit Cleveland on Wednesday , while var_team[0][TEAM-CITY] will not face off until Saturday in Miami .

Whenever other major components of their respective teams are sidelined , the spotlight shines particularly bright on var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][0][PLAYER_NAME] . With Kyle_Lowry set to miss the remainder of the regular season due to wrist surgery and Kristaps_Porzingis missing multiple games with an ankle injury , such a scenario is presently playing itself out for the pair of superstars . Unsurprisingly , they both are responding in impressive fashion , and fittingly , the outcome of Monday 's contest ended up in the hands of both players . In what was a back - and - forth fourth period , var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] gave the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) a var_team[1][TEAM-PTS] - 91 lead with var_player[1][3][PF] second remaining with an 18 - foot basket . That left the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] ( var_player[0][0][PTS] - var_team[0][TEAM-LOSSES] ) with var_player[0][0][STL] possession and they naturally opted to get the ball into the hands of var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] . The perennial All-Star went for broke , putting up a 25 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer that failed to find the net , clinching the hard - fought road win for var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] . var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] compiled a game - high var_player[1][3][MIN] points , which he supplemented with var_player[1][3][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][3][TO] assists and var_player[1][3][PF] steal . With var_player[1][3][SECOND_NAME] putting up var_player[1][3][FGA] shots , var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] was a distant second with var_player[1][1][PTS] points , var_player[1][1][FTA] rebounds and var_player[1][1][BLK] block . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] totaled var_player[1][2][PTS] points , var_player[1][2][REB] boards , var_player[1][2][FTA] steals and var_player[1][2][BLK] block . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] supplied var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] boards and a pair of dimes . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] , now presumably the starting point guard for the remainder of the campaign , contributed a modest var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][FG3A] rebounds and var_player[1][4][TO] steals over var_player[1][4][MIN] minutes . var_player[0][0][SECOND_NAME] paced the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] with var_team[0][TEAM-PTS_QTR4] points , var_player[0][0][FTA] rebounds , var_player[0][0][FG3M] assists and var_player[0][0][OREB] steal . var_player[0][4][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[0][3][PLAYER_NAME] were next with matching var_player[0][4][PTS] - point efforts , with the former adding var_player[0][4][FTA] rebounds , var_player[0][4][AST] assists and var_player[0][3][TO] steals , and the latter supplying var_player[0][3][AST] rebounds , var_player[0][3][AST] assists , var_player[0][3][STL] steals and var_player[0][3][TO] blocks . var_player[0][1][PLAYER_NAME] drew another start for Porzingis and registered var_player[0][1][PTS] points and var_player[0][1][FTA] boards . var_player[0][2][PLAYER_NAME] , now also a potential long - term starter with Joakim_Noah out several weeks after a knee procedure , posted var_player[0][2][PTS] points , var_player[0][2][REB] boards , var_player[0][2][TO] assists and var_player[0][2][STL] steal . The var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] head back home to tangle with the Wizards on Wednesday evening , while the var_team[0][TEAM-NAME] hit the road for a Wednesday night matchup against the Orlando Magic .

A truly balanced offensive attack , superior ball security and stingy defense are a winning combination more often than not , and such was the case for the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] ( var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] - var_team[1][TEAM-LOSSES] ) on Saturday . All var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] members of var_team[1][TEAM-CITY] 's starting var_team[1][TEAM-WINS] tallied double - digit scoring , and super - reserve var_player[1][5][PLAYER_NAME] pitched in off the bench with a var_player[1][5][PTS] - point , var_player[1][5][REB] - rebound double - double as well .

The visitors also built themselves a cushion early , winning the first quarter by a 36 - 21 margin that would serve them well the rest of the way . var_player[1][0][PLAYER_NAME] posted var_player[1][0][PTS] points , var_player[1][0][REB] rebounds , var_player[1][0][DREB] assists , var_player[1][0][STL] steals and a block to lead the var_team[1][TEAM-NAME] . var_player[1][1][PLAYER_NAME] chipped in with var_player[1][1][FG3_PCT] points , var_player[1][1][AST] assists , a rebound and var_player[1][1][STL] steals . var_player[1][2][PLAYER_NAME] and var_player[1][3][PLAYER_NAME] supplied a pair of var_player[1][3][PTS] - point efforts , with the former also hauling in var_player[1][2][REB] rebounds and recording var_player[1][3][STL] steals and the latter posting a rebound , and a pair of assists and steals apiece . var_player[1][4][PLAYER_NAME] rounded out the strong night for the starting var_player[1][4][FGM] with var_player[1][4][PTS] points , var_player[1][4][AST] assists , var_player[1][4][REB] rebounds and var_player[1][4][DREB] steals .

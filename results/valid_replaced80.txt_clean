Mason Plumlee 's performance against the Clippers on Monday night was only replicated by 2 other NBA players this season - - Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo . That 's fairly elite company to belong to , especially considering the fact that both Durant and Antetokounmpo are wings that have the ball a lot , while Plumlee is not seen as a ball - dominant center . But while the company is elite , the stat line is n't totally shocking considering the numbers Plumlee has posted this season , especially , shockingly enough , in the assist column . Monday was the eighth time in 26 games this season where the big man has posted at least six assists , the 10th time he 's dished out at least five assists and the 19th time he 's had at least four assists . In fact , his average is currently 4 per game . For a big man , that 's a very impressive number , and given Plumlee 's ability to dish out the ball for scores on a consistent basis , this may not be the last time the Duke graduate posts a stat line like the 1 he had on Monday .

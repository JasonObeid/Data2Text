Mason Plumlee 's performance against the Clippers on Monday night was only replicated by 2 other NBA players this season - - Kevin_Durant and Giannis_Antetokounmpo . That 's fairly elite company to belong to , especially considering the fact that both Durant and Antetokounmpo are wings that have the ball a lot , while Plumlee is not seen as a ball - dominant center .

Monday was the eighth time in 26 games this season where the big man has posted at least six assists , the 10th time he 's dished out at least five assists and the 19th time he 's had at least four assists .
